#Why The Apple Upgrade Cycle Will Only Speed Up. And Up. And Up.#
Mashable are featuring a great Op-Ed piece today "<a href="http://mashable.com/2012/10/23/ipad-3-owner-oped/">IPad 3 Owner Burned</a>".

The article talks about the consumer's feeling of being "burned" as Apple announce the iPad 4 just 7 months after the release of the iPad 3. The new model will have <em></em><em> significantly</em> higher specifications, and the resale value of existing iPad3 is crashing as a result.

As the article points out, this problem really only affects the specific type of user who early-adopts Apple products and who is ready and willing to queue in line for the "next best model". It also points out that Apples timeline between hardware updates is getting shorter and shorter. Whilst the iPhone release has become an almost annual event, mostly I suspect to tie in with expiration of mobile phone contracts, the iPad release schedule is gaining speed.

<em><strong>So, why are Apple releasing hardware updates faster and faster?</strong></em>

Personally. I think the answer lies in the arms race that Apple now find themselves in against every Android vendor our there. Not so much the unknown brands turning out Android powered tablet devices for the budget concious, but the likes of Samsung, Google, and Amazon.

The iPad Mini launch has already given us all the opportunity to compare the specs of the new iPad Mini to our favourite Android devices, and the results look good for Android. Just check out this article from Android Headlines to see<a href="http://androidheadlines.com/2012/10/featured-how-does-the-apple-ipad-mini-compare-to-the-google-nexus-7.html"> how far behind the spec of the Nexus 7 the iPad Mini is</a> <em>already. </em>Remember, Google are already working on their next version of this device.

Apple stole the march on pretty much an entire industry, arguably <em></em><em> creating</em> a new industry, with the launch of the iPad. Now they need to keep up with everyone else, and keeping up may mean releasing new hardware every time a competitor does.

The speed of updates looks like it can only increase, and the risk of burning out loyal customers is now very real.
