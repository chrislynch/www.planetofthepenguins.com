#Is Google Crowd-Sourcing Its Next Algorithm Change? A Cynic's View Of The New Google Disavow Tool#
Google recently announced its new "Disavow Tool", allowing webmasters to disavow "bad links" to their websites.

Amidst all the excitement from SEO types and the sudden surge in articles telling us all how best to use this new tool (no two articles really agreeing, of course), two points for the cynics amongst us seemed to remain unexplored. Following on from <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/googles-disavow-tool-take-a-deep-breath#jtc198031">my post to the SEOMoz forums</a>, I wanted to put down here some of my thoughts on the addition of the tool and what it might <em>really</em> mean for Google, its algorithm, and "negative SEO".

My theory is laid out chronlogically below, with the evolution of SEO being crucial to understanding why I think this tool now exists:
<blockquote>1: "Everyone knows" that Google values links. Link building becomes king and we all spend lots of time trying to build good links. Professional link building begins.

2: Someone figures out that you don't need to do it like that, you can just sell links between sites. Link buying is born.

3: Link Buying becomes a commodity product, as some of it can be automated and what can be automated can be done en-mass by low skilled workers. Sweat shops link farms are born, and we all get the change to buy "100 PR9+ Links for $99".

4: Google start to see the importance of linkage slipping and need to try and stop these dirty tricksters. But, heck, those tricksters and sneaky and do lots of clever things to hide their link farms and pass their battery-farmed link eggs off as good, wholesome, organic eggs.

5: Google need a way to tell which links are good and which links are bad, but that's very difficult and people keep complaining about algorithm updates that don't do what we think they should. If only there was a way they could persuade us to 'fess-up our link building sins...

6: So... Google tell us all that link farms are bad and that if we don't stop using them then the SERP Boogie Man is going to come and kill us in our beds. And penalise our sites, which is worse.

7: Panic begins. "What is someone does it to me?" we cry. "Negative SEO? What's that? Can it be true?"

7: Google say "Don't Panic" and give us a tool to "disavow" those naughty links. The ones that they can't find that easily.

8: Everyone jumps on and shops any naughty links. Sweat is wiped from brows and everyone gets to tell their SEO clients that their nose is well and truly clean.

9: Google site back and collate a big, fat database of confessions from webmasters, then launch their algorithm nukes at the worst offending link farms.</blockquote>
So, am I a cynic or is this as obvious to everyone else as it is to me? Could this be the start of Google moving towards human-editing to help control its index? Or is it just the death of those adverts that off 100 PR9+ links for $99?
