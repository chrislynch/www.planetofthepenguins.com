#Waiting For The Lights To Go Out#
Dorothy had been walking for three hours in the rain. Her dress was wet through, and the tiny coat that she had thrown over her shoulders as a concession to the weather was little more than a sopping rag.

There was no moon overhead, and the noises of the city had long since died.  Everything, it seemed, had died.

All there was was Dorothy, the rain, and the flickering street lights. Two ahead, one behind. Always that, two ahead and one behind. Dorothy didn't know how she knew it, but she knew that she had to stay in the light. The light was safety.

All she had to do was stay in the light.

The light behind Dorothy flickered, and she instinctively skipped two steps forward, cross thorough the point where the light overlapped best. The light behind died a moment later, and a new one sprang up in its place, ahead of Dorothy.

Two ahead, one behind.

Dorothy wished she had listened to her mother and stayed in tonight. She wished she'd shared a cab with her friends, instead of deciding to walk home. She wished that she knew where she was right now, that she could catch some glimpse of the world beyond her little patch of light. She wished the growling would stop, whatever it was. It didn't seem to move, didn't seem to change with the lights. Whatever it was seemed to be right next to her, and yet there was nothing there.

Just the lights, blinking and flickering. Moving her onwards.

Two ahead, one behind.

"Can you hear me love?"

The paramedics huddled over Dorothy, trying to keep the rain off her crumpled body. The engine of the car that hit her was still running, coughing and growling, one of its headlights casting a stark halogen over the bloody scene.

"No pupil response..."  said one of them, flashing a small torch across Dorothy's eyes as he held them open.

"Go again" said the other, "She's still with us..."

"Until they move this car," replied the first. "And then that's it."

"Well, maybe she'll get where she's going," said the other, "Sometimes they do."

"Sometimes"

And in the dark, Dorothy dodged through the lights again, the rumbling growl never leaving her side.
