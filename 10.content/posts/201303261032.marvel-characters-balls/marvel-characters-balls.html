Rather pleased that I will now get hits from weird costume-pervs searching for "Marvel Character's Balls" on Google, I humbly present this rather cool video from [Blackmeal](http://vimeo.com/blackmeal).

It is a great testament, I think, to how iconic the original designs for a lot of the Marvel characters are that they are all instantly recognisable even in faceless spherical form.

The absence of Black Widow sadly means the punning ends now...
