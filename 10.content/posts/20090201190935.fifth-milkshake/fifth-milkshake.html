#Fifth Milkshake#
This poem was originally published on the WordRiot website.
<blockquote>This is my fifth milkshake,
I should really exercise more,
she isn't coming.

I should have brought a book with me,
something intelligent, something cool,
she isn't coming.

I should have offered to meet her somewhere else,
somewhere with reservations,
she isn't coming.

I wonder if people are looking at me.
I wonder if they know
she isn't coming.</blockquote>
