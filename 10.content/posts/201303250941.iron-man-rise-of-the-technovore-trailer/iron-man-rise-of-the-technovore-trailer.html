# Iron Man: Rise of the Technovore Trailer (or "How to make an Iron Man Trailer that is brilliant without telling us the whole story).

There have been a **lot** of Iron Man 3 trailers. Arguably, there have been too many and we can only hope that the trailer-monkeys have not used up all the great moments from the movie as they titillate and tease us.

By contrast, "Iron Man: Rise of the Technovore" has a brilliant, dialogue free trailer. Plenty of action, plenty of 'splosions, plenty of wow, but not a clue as to what is going on in what could quite easily be a bat-shit-crazy anime styled Iron Man romp. (There are other trailers with words, apparently, but I like this one.

Word to the wise though - don't Google this movie too much. I Google-d and must you (in my best pirate voice) - "Thar be spoilers".
