Born in 1978 in Cardiff, Chris Lynch is 50% writer and 50% IT technologist. By day, he is the Head of Software Development for FD Systems and Gravit-e. By night, he is the writer of such things as Monkeys with Machineguns, Hammer of Time, The Magpye and The Dark for Markosia, Wrathbones for 2026 Books, and comic strips for Accent UK, Something Wicked, The Sorrow, and Insomnia Publications.

Last year, his story “Lights Out” was featured in the Small Press section of the Judge Dredd Megazine, coming second only to Dredd himself for ThrillPower. Chris is also a prize winner in the Commonwealth Essay Competition and the JA Konrath Writing Competition.

Over the past few years he’s also written for magazines, web sites, and a wide range of other publications. This website is his combination blog, online portfolio, e-commerce site, and general play area for web technologies that interest him.

In late 2004, Chris formed the comic book studio “Monkeys with Machineguns” with long time friend and artist Stuart Tipples (AKA Stu.Art). Launching their first comic at the Bristol Comic Expo in early 2005, the studio was subsequently contracted to produce a quarterly horror and science fiction anthology for North American publishing outfit Open Book Press and in late 2007 signed a deal with Markosia to publish the four part mini-series “The Magpye”. The duo have become stalwarts of the British convention scene, with short strips appearing in a number of anthologies whilst The Magpye is in development. They are also occasionally let loose on other people’s podcasts, but normally only once!
