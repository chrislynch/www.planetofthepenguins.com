## Secrets and Lies Live at Cardiff Comic Expo

A little late posting this up, but where else would you get the chance to see me 
accidentally get tongue-tied and say “wank” at Paul Cornell, or Charlie Adlard get a question wrong … about himself? Hosted by the inimitable Sidekick Cast, 
I present … [Secrets and Lies Live at the Cardiff Comic Expo 2011](podcasts/secrets_and_lies_at_cardiff_comic_expo).

## Birds of Geek vs. Dan and Chris and why “The Dark is like Watchmen”

Birds of Geek have released their Bristol Comic Expo Special episode, 
featuring back to back interviews with Dan Boultwood (yes, Dan Boultwood on his own without Tony Lee) 
and then, later on, me.

## Two wise monkeys and me: It’s the Comic Book Outsiders Bristol Roundtable!

In 2010 the Bristol Comic Expo played host to a round table discussion between the twin publishing mights 
of Monkeys with Machineguns and Orang Utan comics, the crew from Geek Syndicate, and some hardcore comic fans, 
all masterfully hosted and chaired by the erudite genius Scott Grandison. 

[The result became Comic Book Outsiders Episode 46...](http://comicbookoutsiders.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=618717)

With another year behind all of us, Peter Rogers, Ian Sharman, and myself all took to the floor to talk about our experiences as both publishers and creators, how we got started in the industry, and where we think we are going next. The differing approaches taken by our respective publishing houses/studios hopefully made for an interesting and thought provoking panel.

If not, you will get to hear me

1. Stretch a one beat joke about a table cloth way beyond its sell by date
1. Somehow pull off a callback to a previous joke at the end of the panel
1. Accuse Ian Sharman of “Saying no, but meaning yes”
1. Accuse Peter Rogers of looking like Lynne Faulds Wood
1. Accuse Peter Rogers of being Jessica Fletcher from Murder She Wrote

The topic of digital comics also features heavily, and I do my best to deliver an impassioned plea on behalf of those who like to share comics. I’ll have to listen back to see if I got my point across or not.
