# Birds of Geek vs. Dan and Chris and why “The Dark is like Watchmen”

Birds of Geek have released their Bristol Comic Expo Special episode, featuring back to back interviews with Dan Boultwood (yes, Dan Boultwood on his own without Tony Lee) and then, later on, me.

Dan is on absolutely top form, whimsical and somewhat manic but very informative and open.

I’m … me. Same old, same old. Apparently everyone knows the story of me, Amy and the shelf. Yes, I am “The Shelfpest“.

If you don’t want to listen to the whole thing, skip to about half way through to here the highly quotable “it’s like Watchmen” from Amy Liff. This quote will be on all of our new promotional literature, at least until Alan Moore gets wind of it.
