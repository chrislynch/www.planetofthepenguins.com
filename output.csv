The victim waited in darkness and silence. It was faceless and formless, without past or present. Yet, the victim infinitely preferred the nothingness of the void to what it knew inevitably come after. Time did not exist here, yet the victim was aware that the void would give way, must give way, to the other world and that the time of the other world was passing. And so, it came and would come inexorably after. In the other world they were moving; they were living and thinking their dark, soul-born thoughts. They were plotting, whenever and wherever they were … they never stopped plotting.

The writers were merciless, pathological, and deadly without exception.

It always started in the same way. It always started with the name. It was incantation, enchantment, the black and white magic of the writers. Bound in flesh that lay heavy on its non-existent frame, the victim walked through the door into its bedroom from the void. Its name was Melissa Hunter.

Its form was crude for the moment, shifting as it moved across the room, its flesh more pliable and fluid than true human flesh. Its creation was not yet complete. As the victim walked across the room, furniture appeared as the writer willed it; its wand spilling black lies onto the page that became real in the world of the victim. A bed appeared, generic and indescribably bland, nothing more than a receptacle for a tossed handbag by an unknown designer. The victim looked at the bed suspiciously from the corner of its eye. Time was always different here; details were rich in the writer’s past, lavish and speculative in its future. The details of the bed, of the room, of the victim, were sketchy and ill-defined; it was the writer’s present were things were known and therefore needed little explanation. Still, the bed was disturbing. There was rape before death in the beds of the writer’s present world.

A dressing table appeared, stocked with generic and nameless paraphernalia, then a desk with a computer. The victim sat at the dressing table and looked at itself in the mirror. Its flesh solidified at the writer’s command, the details becoming compelling. The victim was young; its death no doubt meant to be more shocking, more terrible, when it was judged as a theft with a value in years that would not be lived.

The victim, having died uncountable times, viewed all life as equally precious; a moral standpoint that was easy to maintain when the victim’s life was under the control, the very whim, of the unseen but omnipresent master of this world. The true crime was the the writer could create any life that he wished, any world that he wanted, and that with all this power at his command he chose to populate the world with victims created with such care so that every life was a tragedy when lost.

The victim watched as its face solidified and hair grew from its scalp to tumble down to its shoulders. Clothing sprouted and spread across its shapeless figure, only for the material to pinch and bulge as the god-head of the writer spun its thoughts into unreal flesh. It was so often the mirror, as if the writer knew his victim was something more than a creation of ink and thought and limitless imagination, and that he wanted to taunt the victim’s true mind as much as he would taunt the mind and torture the flesh that he would give it. The victim had always considered the writer to be a “he”, not an “it” as the victim considered itself, as gods were so often men in this world.

The victim turned away from the mirror, having brushed its hair and dabbed vaguely at its makeup. The mirror had done its work for now, turning its dead glass eyes over the world, reflecting details that had not been there before. The victim’s head filled with thoughts, memories of a a day just passed that had not truly been. A job, friends, a family far away, a hobby too often neglected and self deprecating thoughts of all the things missing from a life filled with nothingness and lies. The victim realised that this was the life it was about to lose. A gift, of sorts, from the writer.

The victim’s head, full to bursting with memories that belonged to its life but that felt as awkward as borrowed clothes, turned towards the computer. I walked to it, watching as it sprung into a life of its own. The victim’s reflection appeared on the black screen for a moment, whilst the victim became dimly aware of a the new memory of switching on the machine, crudely pasted in retrospect into its mind. The black glass eye of the writer reflected the world for a moment more, etching details into the face of the victim.

The computer’s modem hissed and screeched and crackled. The victim’s hands reached out and splayed across the keyboard. All the keys were blank, as the writer had not told them to be otherwise. The victim started to type; the movement was effortless, one movement and one moment flowing into the next, awkward physical realities ignored with a pen-stroke. The victim didn’t know if the room contained one chair or two, if it had turned on the computer with a switch or a button, if the electricity had been on or off beforehand. In so many ways, the world created by the writers was purer and more potent than the world that they themselves inhabited. The victim did not pity them thought, only longed for its void, for its world, and for an end to the torture of flesh and weight, false thoughts and shallow memories. Could the victim have learned to love this world, as it loved the timeless void that existed in the lapses between the whims of the writers? It would never know, for its purpose was only to live and to die and to live and to die, again and again; its death always more vivid and long lasting than its life.

The victim’s fingers continued to rattle across the unmarked keys, and the monitor that had been the eye of god was filled with images of another world that did not exist within this world that did not exist. Words began to fill the screen, a dialog designed, drafted and choreographed to move the victim towards its end at the hands of the as yet unseen killer. The victim watched and keyed the responses that the writer demanded. Every sentence added another layer to the victim’s history, an extraordinary cruelty as the false mind that the writer created threatened to overwhelm the victim’s own.

Once before, when being torn from the void was still unexpected, the victim had been fooled into forgetting itself and had lost its own mind inside that of the creature that was weaved and sculpted around it in flesh and false histories. The loss, the abandonment of identity had been so total that the victim had not know the void when it returned to it after the stinging kiss of the grave had brushed lips that the victim believed to be its own. But in the void there is no time and so the memories of the otherworld could not exist, fading instead like the night’s frost from a window pane come morning. The victim’s own timeless mind returned as its naked form spun within the infinite emptiness of the void until it had lost all shape and didn’t look like a person at all.

That had been the most bitter death by far and even though the details of that lost life so loved now came only in flashes when the victim’s mind was not quite filled with the shadow fiction of a life new-born in ink and ideas, it knew that it must never forget itself again or risk feeling the icy pain of death as keenly as it had done once, when it had let itself become a person.

More words were spun and the victim began to wonder if this computer, the neglected hobby, was to be the route by which it would meet its demise. Silver-grey memories of other lost lives flicked at the corners of the victim’s mind, dread images of what had been in other times and other places that somehow intruded into this unreal world. The victim knew that the electric world, the world behind the screen, was where the predators of the writer’s world prowled, where its degenerates stalked its innocents and evil lurked beneath the glittering surface of zeroes and ones. The victim waited for the next incantation, waited for the inevitable words that would transform the scene and the world around it. The victim waited, feeling the moment bear down on it, the time of this world taking physical form.

“Where are you?” The victim typed the question and hit a blank key, sending the question into the electric ether, a small piece of bait in its un-life long search for love and companionship. The victim’s heart fluttered in its chest, as the mind of the other, the Mellissa-mind, filled with fantasies of romance. The writer sent words from the tip of its wand to the flickering screen …

“Behind you.”

The victim didn’t move. Time was frozen; the screen held in mid-flicker, the stream of words to it and the world around abruptly ended. Sometimes, the victim had learnt, there were moments like this before a change; before the hand of the writer reached back into the minutes and hours past and changed this reality. What wrinkle, what detail, was changing? A lost set of keys appeared in the victim’s memory as perfectly as if they had always been lost and the victim knew this as surely as it knew its name was Mellisa Hunter and all the details that went with this life. Something else appeared in memory, a forgetful friend who knew that she had the keys “somewhere”. A new face appeared in the victim’s memory and superimposed itself over the face of a friend who no longer existed. To be edited out of existence, how the victim longed for that calm and painless dispatch back into the void.

Time began to move again, sluggishly at first, the universe moving like a sleeper roused from a dream. Words began to flow into the present again, the writer’s pen no longer dipped into the shallow ink well of the past. Time’s gears meshed with a crunch that only the victim could hear, and everything started to move again.

Melissa Hunter span around in her chair. Crouching on the bed behind her was the hulking form of The Killer. He was dressed completely in black and a ski mask with ragged eye holes covered his face. In one gloved hand he held a palm top computer with a glowing blue screen, in the other an eight inch knife with a serrated edge. Melissa scrambled out of the chair and tried to run for the door. This was a time that lasted the longest, the agonisingly detailed time of the kill, the time for the death of the victim.

The Killer leapt from the bed, dropping the computer and reaching out for Melissa with his free hand. It clasped around Melissa’s shoulder, pulling her backwards. Her blouse fell open as she toppled; the victim looked down at the naked flesh of its, of Melissa’s, body. The Killer fell down on top of Melissa, the victim could feel its ribs being crushed as the air was forced from Melissa’s lungs. Beyond its control, the victim’s hands clawed at The Killer and its legs thrashed weakly from side to side. The Killer took a handful of Melissa’s hair and pounded her head against the floor; once, twice, three times, more, until stars filled the victim’s vision and its limbs grew too weak to claw or thrash. Melissa’s consciousness started to fade. This was not death, the victim had felt this softer, warmer sort of fading before. This was unconsciousness, a gift of peace from the writer before it plunged the victim down into some greater horror.

The Killer shifted its mass from the victim’s weakly fluttering chest. Melissa coughed up blood; the victim felt the a warm sticky bubble pop between its lips and splatter on its cheek. Only when you have died in so many, many ways can the taste of blood in your mouth grow familiar. The fireworks and falling stars faded from Melissa’s vision. Her eyes were pointing at a picture of her family who lived so far away. They had no faces, no features or clothes; they were just concepts, abstracts. Everyone’s father, everyone’s mother, everyone’s sister or brother or dog. Just a photo of another normal family, its purpose nothing more than to produce, raise and eventually grieve this victim-child.

The cold top of The Killer’s knife rested on Melissa’s bare abdomen. Her flesh goosebumped and quivered underneath it. The victim lay rigid within Melissa’s flesh, feeling the cold touch of the metal, the involuntary movements of its body as commanded by the writer. Melissa’s head swivelled slowly and uncertainly to face The Killer; her eyes and the victim’s eyes behind locked with his. Were they wild, The Killer’s eyes, feral and animalistic? Were they cold, they eyes of a fiendish calculating machine? What drove this killer, what mystery could be found behind these poorly framed and rendered windows onto his soul?

The victim had been killed in more ways that it could count, by more killers with more dark and twisted and sickening motives than even the timeless and endless halls of purgatory could hold. And yet, this moment was different. The writer’s pen executed the stroke into Melissa’s soft belly, the knife blade following seamlessly behind, and this was no different to the many cuts and punctures that had come in the times before. The gushing blood the pen painted, that splattered onto The Killer and spread out like an ink blot on tissue paper across the floor, was as rich and as warm and as deep a red as ever. The pain … the pain flowed from the tip of the pen as it always had, Melissa and the victim screaming together, but this too was no different than any of the times before.

The difference was in the eyes of The Killer. The writer’s pen ahd crafted them with the same care he had taken to fashion eyes of Melissa so that she could see her killer and lock eyes with him at the moment of her death. From behind Melissa’s eyes, the victim stared into the eyes of the killer and found something that staring back at it from behind those very eyes. The victim locked eyes behind eyes with a creature that it could tell a had killed as many times and in as many ways as the victim itself had been made to die. Something passed between these two time-lost thought-melded creatures then, something beyond the power of the writer’s pen to shape and control and dictate in this world of lies and shadows that lay outside the void. It was a shared history; a history of violence, cruelty, perversion and death. All the victim’s past lives and deaths, but seen from the viewpoint this time of the creature behind the eyes of The Killer. A slave, just like the victim, but one who’s task was not to live and to die again and again, but to kill and to rape and to torture and defile. A black history of murder to match the victim’s uncountable lost lives.

The victim felt the life fading from its body as the last droplets of pain were committed to the page. It could feel the perfect emptiness of the void opening up to receive it again; a child unborn back into the womb. Would the memories of this life be lost, like all the time and place spun stories, or would the victim remember what it had shared and learned in these past moments? In either case, as the victim faded back into the void, as Melissa Hunter was no more, it felt the painful strokes of the pen less keenly. The victims would be born into lives worth loosing only to die and to die again; but there were other ways, far worse ways, to be a slave and a victim of the writer’s whim."

The Longest Day was written for the alt.fiction.original newsgroup, just to prove that I can do funny (sometimes) as well as scary ...
<blockquote>Judgement day was full of surprises.

Firstly, there was the moon of blood. Only the astrologers cared at first, until Coca-Cola found a way to trace their corporate logo across the scarlet disk with a high powered white laser light.

Then the sky went black, leaving the entire world under the dull red light of the blood moon. Photographers were mildly encouraged that the afterlife might resemble a dark room, and torch manufacturers recorded record sales.

The police predicted a massive increase in crime in this world that looked like a perpetual sunset, and were prepared for riots and looting. Thankfully, something to do with the presence of the all-mighty and the imminent judgement of all souls, kept people mostly at home. The only places that were busier than normal were the churches, which found themselves packed to the rafters with sudden converts, and the tanning parlours that saw increased traffic after a popular fashion magazine reported that the red moonlight made some celebrities look pasty.

Some people questioned the notion of a judgement “day” in the following weeks, when it appeared that the all-mighty may have slipped on his delivery date for this one. The church’s official response was that a day is measured from sunrise to sunset and since the sun had failed to rise, there had not been a new day in five weeks.

Just as life was returning to a semblance of normality, the dead began to rise from their graves. Or at least they tried to, but the very practical burying of the dead six feet down did serve as some impediment to the tired and frankly unfit and under-exercised corpses who now found themselves boxed and sunk with not so much as a trowel or small pickaxe. In countries where cremation was preferred to burying there were no such problems, although roving and strangely mischievous dust storms were reported in several cities.

Most of the dead were quickly rescued from their underground internment, although comments were made in several quarters about the lack of forethought in burying people one on top of the other. With no known date for the end of judgement “day”, several companies began offering “casket management systems” that claimed to remove multiple caskets simultaneously from a single grave and arrange them vertically for easy access. There was little call for these however, as most the industrious undertakers, having discovered that there was now no death, had reinvented themselves as “loved one retrieval specialists”.

The dead who were trapped underneath patios or in the foundations of buildings were more difficult to get at, and it was these that the undertakers found to be the most lucrative jobs. The police were initially keen to track the retrieval of these concealed corpses, but lawyers were quick to point out that since the dead had risen from the graves, all current or potential convictions for murder should be null and void. Thus, with no new criminals to defend, the lawyers found a burgeoning market in getting the old criminals they had failed to keep out of prison in the first place back out of prison on a growing list of judgement-day technicalities.

Several weeks into the dead-raising, the first practical problem of having dead people back among the living arose. It had long been a stated fact amongst environmentalists and people of low social tolerance that the planet was overcrowded. When the sodden earth disgorged its population, most people became strangely inclined to agree. Whereas many of the recent dead had relatives who were happy to put them up in cupboards, or underneath the sink, there were many that did not having any living relatives. Entire families, colloquially referred to as being “at the end of the line”, found themselves with nowhere to go.

Thankfully, the inventors of the “casket management systems” were quick to pounce on this problem, and quickly converted the now defunct machinery for getting caskets out of the ground into machinery for putting them back in, and then out again, ad infinitum. Thus, as the living built their buildings taller and taller to cope with their growing population, the dead found themselves digging deeper and deeper until their subterranean refuges had grown large enough to accommodate their considerable numbers. Thankfully, with no death, the difficult matter of people moving from the world of the living to the world of the dead was not encountered.

Automation of the underground facilities was increased until it was possible for a corpse to be popped from its casket and whizzed to ground level in a matter of minutes at the touch of a button.

Time moved on, as it had a tendency to do despite the conviction of the church, and the dead and the living found themselves cohabiting with surprisingly few problems in the early months of judgement day.

Problems did occur however, when the dead started to get a bit bored and began to think about getting themselves jobs. Through yet another legal loophole, it was discovered that the dead did not have to pay any form of taxes, making them ideal employees for anyone who wanted to pay a wage as low as possible for work that no one in their right mind would want to do. Although most of the living where uninterested in this; the teenagers who discovered themselves discharged from their jobs stacking shelves, serving burgers, or collecting glasses in pubs were greatly disgruntled. This disgruntlement was exacerbated by the fact that, as time passed, it became clear that they were not aging and were destined to be trapped in the form of hormonally raging unemployable pubescent psychotics for the rest of eternity.

Or at least until the end of the day.

And so it came to pass that “Peter Pan’s Law” was drafted by the international court. Australia was nominated as the continent of the teenager and all people over the age of eighteen or younger than twelve were required to relocate to another continent, an evacuation that was completely remarkably swiftly once everyone was told that an uncountable legion of teens were about to arrive.

Country by country, the nations of the world rounded up their children and transported them to Australia where they were placed in the careful care of the “Oz-Rangers”. Not only did the Oz-Rangers provide a much needed security service, but also solved the problem of what to do with all the criminals previously housed in prisons who now, like the dead, had nowhere to go.

Naturally, the church initially objected to the treatment of the world’s sons and daughters in this way, until it was pointed out that perhaps God would be able to deliver the rest of judgement-day more expediently if the living organised themselves by size.</blockquote>"

<blockquote>Hello.

My name is Katie and I am nine years old. You don’t have a name yet because you are just my imaginary friend. I wish I had real friends, but you will have to do. I’m locked in a box at the moment you see, and I don’t think anyone else will fit in here with me.

I’ve been here for a few hours, I think. I’m not sure how I got to be in this box, although I am quite sure that I used to know. When I first woke up I was very scared, and very hungry. I felt like I had been asleep for a hundred years. Its very dark in here and I can’t really see very much. I found a piece of cake on the floor of my box as I moved around, I ate it, and since then I have been forgetting more things that I can remember.

I think I used to have real friends, and a family, but I can’t be certain. For all I know, I might always have lived in this box and that might be quite normal. Perhaps I banged my head, rolling around in my sleep, and now my brain is all wrong. I’ve heard that can happen, but I’m not sure where. I wish you could tell me what you think.

There are noises outside the box. Things bang, click, clank, and thud. I hear voices often, although mostly they are muffled and far away. Sometimes I box feels like it is being moved, as if there are things behind it that someone wants to get to. The voices say bad things then, and I try not to listen. I don’t think I am a nuisance, I am very quiet in my box and disturb no-one. Still, the voice says that I will be gone soon, and so I try not to worry. I am sure wherever I am going will be much more convenient for everyone.

Anyway, I wanted you to be here because I’ve heard one voice say that friends are coming to have tea with it. It’s a croaky voice, like an old lady who has swallowed a toad and can’t get it all the way down her throat. The voice is very excited, and it sings to itself amongst the rattles and clanks and hisses and bubbles somewhere outside my box. I don’t recognise the language that the songs are in.

Seeing as the voice was having friends around, I thought it was only fair that I did too. The voice doesn’t seem to want to ask me what I want to do. Another voice arrived just before you did. This one is a man’s voice, it rolls around outside the box like thunder. I think the croaky one said that another friend was coming as well. I hope their voice is not as loud as the new man’s voice. He frightens me a bit.

If you look up, you can see the odd shadow moving on the lid of the box. I suppose a little light must creep in between the cracks, though not enough to see by. I’ve searched for more cake, I think it is very rude to have nothing to offer your guest, but I am afraid that the box seems to be empty except for you and me.

I think the voices have food. If you listen carefully, you can hear the sound of plates being put down on top of the box. I wish I could see what they are eating. I can smell warm cakes, fresh from the oven. I don’t know how I know the smell, perhaps it is one of things that I haven’t forgotten yet, although I seem to have already forgotten how I know it. Things are very confusing in the box. Perhaps you can remember some things for me?

Of course you can’t because you are just imaginary. Perhaps I can imagine that you remember them, and that will help me to remember.

The voices are speaking again, can you hear what they are saying?

“Did you give it to him?” the croaky one says.

“Of course,” says the booming one. His voice is so loud, can you feel how it rattles the box?

“Did you get a fair price?”

“For a super-bowl touchdown? My dear, you know how important the stupidest things can be to them. There is only one price that is fair.”

“Been a while since I had a fresh, young soul. Most of the people I get in here trying to sell theirs have already worn them practically through, and I didn’t think the young ones still even believed nowadays.”

“I believe the young man had the benefit of a religious upbringing.”

They are laughing now. I don’t understand what’s so funny. Perhaps I can’t remember how jokes work.

There’s a tinkling noise far away, a tiny bell. Can you hear the footsteps? I think this is the third voice come for tea.

“Hello Miranda,” says the croaky one.

“Hello.”

The one who says “Hello” back has a soft voice. I like it much better than the others. I don’t dare to speak, but I hope my voice would sound like that one if I did. I can’t remember what my own voice sounds like. Is that quite normal do you think?

“Greetings.”

That’s the booming one. He sounds pleased to see this new one.

“Am I too late?”

“Not at all Miranda, we were just pouring the tea.”

“Nettle?”

“Blackberry.”

“Ooh splendid.”

“I got a bag of it from a warlock, traded those old cat skins that I’ve had laying around for ages.”

“What on earth did he want those for?”

“I don’t think he was going to use them on Earth dear.”

“Ah, I see. Do you think you should have sold them to him then?”

“Oh I don’t see the harm. After all, how many warlocks do you know who come back from that trip?”

“Warlocks? Oh,well … none!”

Can you hear them all laughing again? I don’t understand what they are talking about, but if it is making the booming one laugh then I just know that it is something bad. I’m sorry I made you come here, because I don’t think this is a good place anymore.

The croaky one is asking questions now.

“How’s business your end?”

“Oh you know, Valentine’s coming up, so I’m getting lots of new people through the door looking for advice.”

“Ah, love spells.”

“Actually, Cupid seems to be more into curses than charms this year. I’m advising young lovers not to make any long-term plans.”

“Very wise, very wise.”

Are you still there? It’s gotten darker in here, I don’t know how because it was so dark before, but it is definitely darker now. I think the booming one is standing up now; I feel cold, as if something is blocking out wherever my warmth was coming from. Don’t ask me how I know, but his shadow has fallen me and my little box. Can you feel it? Tell me, please, that you can feel it.

The plates are moving again. They don’t seem to have had them there long enough to eat very much at all. Perhaps they were just having afternoon tea, a drink and a slice of cake before doing whatever it is that they do in the afternoon. The shadows that were where the plates were aren’t disappearing, even though I am sure the plates are being taken away. I can hear them clattering into a sink, and the sound of running water. What is it that you do with plates when they are dirty?

“Shall we open it up then?”

The booming one is speaking, and he sounds much closer now. I thought he was just outside the box before, but now he sounds so much closer and louder, as if there was something more than just the walls of the box between him and me before. Now I know for certain that there is only the lid of this box between me and booming man. I am very afraid, and wish I hadn’t brought you here, even though it will be nice to have someone with me when I meet him. Would you hold my hand?

We’ll have to close our eyes soon, because I hear them opening the the box, and it’s sure to be bright outside. I think it is nailed shut, they are using something long and metal that pokes in underneath the lid as they try and prise it open.

“Lid’s on tight,” says the croaky one. “She’s a little bigger than usual, a real find.”

“Excellent,” says the booming one.

“What fun.”

Keep your eyes closed. Keep your eyes closed. I can feel the light coming in, it’s so bright, it’s making my eyelids burn. Keep your eyes closed, hold my hand. I’m sorry I never had time to name you. I think I probably would have forgotten your name anyway, because I can’t really remember anything now.

My name is Katie, and I am nine years old, but when I look into the big black eyes of the booming man I can see my reflection and I look a lot older. His face is bright red, and his mouth is full of jagged yellow teeth. He has long, pointed ears that twitch when I open my mouth to speak, and a tongue that pokes out at me when he realises I can’t think of anything to say.

“Hello Katie.” says the booming man.

I’m going to let go of your hand now, because I don’t want him to know that you are here.

“How old is she?”

I can’t turn around to see what the honey-voiced one looks like. I can’t take my eyes off the booming man, and the naked girl staring back at me from inside his giant black eyes.

“Her driver’s license says she’s eighteen this month. I caught her trying to steal a book this morning.” It is the croaking one that replies. She is behind me as well, just a shadow looming in the eyes of the booming man.

“Another one of your familiars?” asks honey-voice.

“Oh no, not one of mine. I’ve seen her around, but no potential to speak of. She didn’t even know not to eat the memnos-cake I left in there with her.”

“Ah, I was wondering how you’d kept her so quiet.”

“And so afraid,” adds the booming man with a smile that looks like a row of gravestones. “There’s nothing less palatable than defiant meat.”

“I’d say she’s lost almost ten years in there,” says the crone. There’s pride in her voice.

“If only there was something like that for our old frames, eh Gerta?”

The crone and honey-voice laugh together.

“This one looks good enough to eat though,” says the booming man.

“Our thoughts exactly,” coo the others.

And then they all laugh together. I think I know why.</blockquote>"

Death of a Victim was awarded third place in the first ever <a href=""http://www.joekonrath.com/"">J.A. Konrath writing competition</a> and was also awarded <strong>""story of the week""</strong> in Alaric’s weekly review of the alt.fiction.original newsgroup for the week 15th - 21st May 2003.
<blockquote>The victim waited in darkness and silence. It was faceless and formless, without past or present. Yet, the victim infinitely preferred the nothingness of the void to what it knew inevitably come after. Time did not exist here, yet the victim was aware that the void would give way, must give way, to the other world and that the time of the other world was passing. And so, it came and would come inexorably after. In the other world they were moving; they were living and thinking their dark, soul-born thoughts. They were plotting, whenever and wherever they were … they never stopped plotting.

The writers were merciless, pathological, and deadly without exception.

It always started in the same way. It always started with the name. It was incantation, enchantment, the black and white magic of the writers. Bound in flesh that lay heavy on its non-existent frame, the victim walked through the door into its bedroom from the void. Its name was Melissa Hunter.

Its form was crude for the moment, shifting as it moved across the room, its flesh more pliable and fluid than true human flesh. Its creation was not yet complete. As the victim walked across the room, furniture appeared as the writer willed it; its wand spilling black lies onto the page that became real in the world of the victim. A bed appeared, generic and indescribably bland, nothing more than a receptacle for a tossed handbag by an unknown designer. The victim looked at the bed suspiciously from the corner of its eye. Time was always different here; details were rich in the writer’s past, lavish and speculative in its future. The details of the bed, of the room, of the victim, were sketchy and ill-defined; it was the writer’s present were things were known and therefore needed little explanation. Still, the bed was disturbing. There was rape before death in the beds of the writer’s present world.

A dressing table appeared, stocked with generic and nameless paraphernalia, then a desk with a computer. The victim sat at the dressing table and looked at itself in the mirror. Its flesh solidified at the writer’s command, the details becoming compelling. The victim was young; its death no doubt meant to be more shocking, more terrible, when it was judged as a theft with a value in years that would not be lived.

The victim, having died uncountable times, viewed all life as equally precious; a moral standpoint that was easy to maintain when the victim’s life was under the control, the very whim, of the unseen but omnipresent master of this world. The true crime was the the writer could create any life that he wished, any world that he wanted, and that with all this power at his command he chose to populate the world with victims created with such care so that every life was a tragedy when lost.

The victim watched as its face solidified and hair grew from its scalp to tumble down to its shoulders. Clothing sprouted and spread across its shapeless figure, only for the material to pinch and bulge as the god-head of the writer spun its thoughts into unreal flesh. It was so often the mirror, as if the writer knew his victim was something more than a creation of ink and thought and limitless imagination, and that he wanted to taunt the victim’s true mind as much as he would taunt the mind and torture the flesh that he would give it. The victim had always considered the writer to be a “he”, not an “it” as the victim considered itself, as gods were so often men in this world.

The victim turned away from the mirror, having brushed its hair and dabbed vaguely at its makeup. The mirror had done its work for now, turning its dead glass eyes over the world, reflecting details that had not been there before. The victim’s head filled with thoughts, memories of a a day just passed that had not truly been. A job, friends, a family far away, a hobby too often neglected and self deprecating thoughts of all the things missing from a life filled with nothingness and lies. The victim realised that this was the life it was about to lose. A gift, of sorts, from the writer.

The victim’s head, full to bursting with memories that belonged to its life but that felt as awkward as borrowed clothes, turned towards the computer. I walked to it, watching as it sprung into a life of its own. The victim’s reflection appeared on the black screen for a moment, whilst the victim became dimly aware of a the new memory of switching on the machine, crudely pasted in retrospect into its mind. The black glass eye of the writer reflected the world for a moment more, etching details into the face of the victim.

The computer’s modem hissed and screeched and crackled. The victim’s hands reached out and splayed across the keyboard. All the keys were blank, as the writer had not told them to be otherwise. The victim started to type; the movement was effortless, one movement and one moment flowing into the next, awkward physical realities ignored with a pen-stroke. The victim didn’t know if the room contained one chair or two, if it had turned on the computer with a switch or a button, if the electricity had been on or off beforehand. In so many ways, the world created by the writers was purer and more potent than the world that they themselves inhabited. The victim did not pity them thought, only longed for its void, for its world, and for an end to the torture of flesh and weight, false thoughts and shallow memories. Could the victim have learned to love this world, as it loved the timeless void that existed in the lapses between the whims of the writers? It would never know, for its purpose was only to live and to die and to live and to die, again and again; its death always more vivid and long lasting than its life.

The victim’s fingers continued to rattle across the unmarked keys, and the monitor that had been the eye of god was filled with images of another world that did not exist within this world that did not exist. Words began to fill the screen, a dialog designed, drafted and choreographed to move the victim towards its end at the hands of the as yet unseen killer. The victim watched and keyed the responses that the writer demanded. Every sentence added another layer to the victim’s history, an extraordinary cruelty as the false mind that the writer created threatened to overwhelm the victim’s own.

Once before, when being torn from the void was still unexpected, the victim had been fooled into forgetting itself and had lost its own mind inside that of the creature that was weaved and sculpted around it in flesh and false histories. The loss, the abandonment of identity had been so total that the victim had not know the void when it returned to it after the stinging kiss of the grave had brushed lips that the victim believed to be its own. But in the void there is no time and so the memories of the otherworld could not exist, fading instead like the night’s frost from a window pane come morning. The victim’s own timeless mind returned as its naked form spun within the infinite emptiness of the void until it had lost all shape and didn’t look like a person at all.

That had been the most bitter death by far and even though the details of that lost life so loved now came only in flashes when the victim’s mind was not quite filled with the shadow fiction of a life new-born in ink and ideas, it knew that it must never forget itself again or risk feeling the icy pain of death as keenly as it had done once, when it had let itself become a person.

More words were spun and the victim began to wonder if this computer, the neglected hobby, was to be the route by which it would meet its demise. Silver-grey memories of other lost lives flicked at the corners of the victim’s mind, dread images of what had been in other times and other places that somehow intruded into this unreal world. The victim knew that the electric world, the world behind the screen, was where the predators of the writer’s world prowled, where its degenerates stalked its innocents and evil lurked beneath the glittering surface of zeroes and ones. The victim waited for the next incantation, waited for the inevitable words that would transform the scene and the world around it. The victim waited, feeling the moment bear down on it, the time of this world taking physical form.

“Where are you?” The victim typed the question and hit a blank key, sending the question into the electric ether, a small piece of bait in its un-life long search for love and companionship. The victim’s heart fluttered in its chest, as the mind of the other, the Mellissa-mind, filled with fantasies of romance. The writer sent words from the tip of its wand to the flickering screen …

“Behind you.”

The victim didn’t move. Time was frozen; the screen held in mid-flicker, the stream of words to it and the world around abruptly ended. Sometimes, the victim had learnt, there were moments like this before a change; before the hand of the writer reached back into the minutes and hours past and changed this reality. What wrinkle, what detail, was changing? A lost set of keys appeared in the victim’s memory as perfectly as if they had always been lost and the victim knew this as surely as it knew its name was Mellisa Hunter and all the details that went with this life. Something else appeared in memory, a forgetful friend who knew that she had the keys “somewhere”. A new face appeared in the victim’s memory and superimposed itself over the face of a friend who no longer existed. To be edited out of existence, how the victim longed for that calm and painless dispatch back into the void.

Time began to move again, sluggishly at first, the universe moving like a sleeper roused from a dream. Words began to flow into the present again, the writer’s pen no longer dipped into the shallow ink well of the past. Time’s gears meshed with a crunch that only the victim could hear, and everything started to move again.

Melissa Hunter span around in her chair. Crouching on the bed behind her was the hulking form of The Killer. He was dressed completely in black and a ski mask with ragged eye holes covered his face. In one gloved hand he held a palm top computer with a glowing blue screen, in the other an eight inch knife with a serrated edge. Melissa scrambled out of the chair and tried to run for the door. This was a time that lasted the longest, the agonisingly detailed time of the kill, the time for the death of the victim.

The Killer leapt from the bed, dropping the computer and reaching out for Melissa with his free hand. It clasped around Melissa’s shoulder, pulling her backwards. Her blouse fell open as she toppled; the victim looked down at the naked flesh of its, of Melissa’s, body. The Killer fell down on top of Melissa, the victim could feel its ribs being crushed as the air was forced from Melissa’s lungs. Beyond its control, the victim’s hands clawed at The Killer and its legs thrashed weakly from side to side. The Killer took a handful of Melissa’s hair and pounded her head against the floor; once, twice, three times, more, until stars filled the victim’s vision and its limbs grew too weak to claw or thrash. Melissa’s consciousness started to fade. This was not death, the victim had felt this softer, warmer sort of fading before. This was unconsciousness, a gift of peace from the writer before it plunged the victim down into some greater horror.

The Killer shifted its mass from the victim’s weakly fluttering chest. Melissa coughed up blood; the victim felt the a warm sticky bubble pop between its lips and splatter on its cheek. Only when you have died in so many, many ways can the taste of blood in your mouth grow familiar. The fireworks and falling stars faded from Melissa’s vision. Her eyes were pointing at a picture of her family who lived so far away. They had no faces, no features or clothes; they were just concepts, abstracts. Everyone’s father, everyone’s mother, everyone’s sister or brother or dog. Just a photo of another normal family, its purpose nothing more than to produce, raise and eventually grieve this victim-child.

The cold top of The Killer’s knife rested on Melissa’s bare abdomen. Her flesh goosebumped and quivered underneath it. The victim lay rigid within Melissa’s flesh, feeling the cold touch of the metal, the involuntary movements of its body as commanded by the writer. Melissa’s head swivelled slowly and uncertainly to face The Killer; her eyes and the victim’s eyes behind locked with his. Were they wild, The Killer’s eyes, feral and animalistic? Were they cold, they eyes of a fiendish calculating machine? What drove this killer, what mystery could be found behind these poorly framed and rendered windows onto his soul?

The victim had been killed in more ways that it could count, by more killers with more dark and twisted and sickening motives than even the timeless and endless halls of purgatory could hold. And yet, this moment was different. The writer’s pen executed the stroke into Melissa’s soft belly, the knife blade following seamlessly behind, and this was no different to the many cuts and punctures that had come in the times before. The gushing blood the pen painted, that splattered onto The Killer and spread out like an ink blot on tissue paper across the floor, was as rich and as warm and as deep a red as ever. The pain … the pain flowed from the tip of the pen as it always had, Melissa and the victim screaming together, but this too was no different than any of the times before.

The difference was in the eyes of The Killer. The writer’s pen ahd crafted them with the same care he had taken to fashion eyes of Melissa so that she could see her killer and lock eyes with him at the moment of her death. From behind Melissa’s eyes, the victim stared into the eyes of the killer and found something that staring back at it from behind those very eyes. The victim locked eyes behind eyes with a creature that it could tell a had killed as many times and in as many ways as the victim itself had been made to die. Something passed between these two time-lost thought-melded creatures then, something beyond the power of the writer’s pen to shape and control and dictate in this world of lies and shadows that lay outside the void. It was a shared history; a history of violence, cruelty, perversion and death. All the victim’s past lives and deaths, but seen from the viewpoint this time of the creature behind the eyes of The Killer. A slave, just like the victim, but one who’s task was not to live and to die again and again, but to kill and to rape and to torture and defile. A black history of murder to match the victim’s uncountable lost lives.

The victim felt the life fading from its body as the last droplets of pain were committed to the page. It could feel the perfect emptiness of the void opening up to receive it again; a child unborn back into the womb. Would the memories of this life be lost, like all the time and place spun stories, or would the victim remember what it had shared and learned in these past moments? In either case, as the victim faded back into the void, as Melissa Hunter was no more, it felt the painful strokes of the pen less keenly. The victims would be born into lives worth loosing only to die and to die again; but there were other ways, far worse ways, to be a slave and a victim of the writer’s whim.</blockquote>"

<blockquote>Chris Lynch and Stu.art make up the MWM studio. They've published three successful editions of their horror anthology, all of which are to a high standard.

Focusing on horror, but with a few different twists, MWM delivers a complete package. Stuart's art and Chris' writing go together very well, as does the art from some of the other artists featured. It's really a showcase for Chris' imaginative stories and Stuart's art, but they deserve it. Stuart's dark, shadow heavy artwork really suits the title, and Chris has a certain liking toward the horror genre that shows in some great short stories.

At a fairly standard US comics price of £2.50 and (£2.39 for #1), it's a tad more than most indie titles, but the quality shows.</blockquote>"

<blockquote><strong>The new wave of UK ""Horror"" comics has arrived...</strong>
Although MWM (sub-titled ""Making Deals With Devils"") is usually filed under the all encompassing wing of wing of Horror comics, to do so does the title a discredit, as there's a lot more to the four tales contained within, than the usual splat and gore that tries to pass itself as ""modern horror"", especially in the sense of graphical and comic work...

Owing more to the likes of EC Comics, The Twilight Zone and early seventies movie compendiums like ""Asylum"", ""Making Deals With Devils"" delivers tales with a twist, and like all the best examples of this genre, you don't see the twist coming until the final frame - esp. in ""The Exchange"" (although, with ""Thirty Pieces"", the title gives away the ending, and as soo as the Romnas apear, well, I knew I was on the right track, but it's a still an enjoyable romp)...

If you like the ""good old days"" and believe (as do I!), that there's far more to horror and suspense than buckets of blood and dying virgins and are looking for one of the best British comic titles to emerge in the last decade, then you owe it to yourself to check out MWM...Seriously. The era of late night chills and frights has returned, and I couldn't be happier...</blockquote>"

<blockquote>So let’s take a look at those automatic weapon wielding simians, the Monkeys with Machineguns. Issue two was available at the Expo, and I’ve been trying to work out what the hell to say about it for about two weeks.

I mean, what do you say about a book like this. It’s an anthology of the most piquant wit, perfectly balanced by a dash of horror and some truly flavoursome twists. This time the monkeys offer us strange alternate realities, ending worlds, red snow, and the most unexpected ending to a letter from the trenches I’ve ever read.

Resident scribe Chris Lynch handles it all with the style and aplomb I’ve come to expect from him over the last couple of years, and once again the art blends beautifully with his words. The stark brutality of Stu.Art is present once again, accompanied this time by a strip from the more cartoony pen of Christian Ward. Very different styles which give this anthology a deliciously eclectic feel.

The big innovation in this issue though, is the total abandonment of the traditional comics format for two of the story segments. ”Why Snow shouldn’t be red” is an illustrated prose story, while Photonic Graffiti is a collection of, well, I guess a collection of photo poems.

That might sound a little poncey, but they’re all written by Chris Lynch, so naturally they’re not. The Photonic Graffiti section is in fact both mesmerising and chilling, as Lynch allows his darker voice full reign. Two of these one page vignettes in particular stood out. The frighteningly ambiguous Burn Baby Burn is truly terrifying, while the wonderfully psychotic Gone with the Wind is a study in obsession that made be laugh so hard I snorted Coca-Cola out of my nose!

What more of a recommendation do you need?

This is a hugely entertaining, strangely haunting and dangerously thought provoking book. You should give it a look, you really should.</blockquote>"

<blockquote>Making Deals With Devils is a black and white horror anthology comic which contains four stories written by Chris Lynch. Art on three of the stories; Left Behind, The Exchange and Wrathbones, is by Stu.Art and on the fourth is by Dark Smith.

Stu.Art’s (presumably not a real name) work is reminiscent of Mike Mignola though with a much heavier line and Dark Smith’s (again a pseudonym) is reminiscent of John Hickleton (for those old enough to remember 2000Ad’s Nemesis The Warlock).

Only three of the stories contained in the book were available for preview, but none the less the quality of the storytelling was pretty high and the stories are genuinely interesting and unsettling.

In Left Behind a man sits in his flat contemplating why his girlfriend has suddenly and unexpectedly left him and her cat. When the cat also leaves, he follows it hoping it will lead him to wherever she has moved to and gets a nasty surprise. This is the best of the three stories reviewed and suggests that given the opportunity, Lynch and Stu.Art could go on to better things.

Thirty Pieces tells the twisted tale of a taxi driver who accidentally knocks down a man fleeing from mysterious and supernatural enemies.

The Exchange offers the most disturbing story as an old woman negotiates a new place to live with a family who have found themselves suddenly down on their luck.

The stories are a good once-off read, but as with many of the ultra short stories you get in a comic book anthology they have little depth beyond their surprise value or their sting in the tale so are not likely to end up on anyone’s must read again pile.

In fact, a second read of The Exchange reveals some narrative liberties which while useful to maintain the surprise, detract from the satisfaction of the story as you realise that you’ve been slightly cheated rather than misdirected by your own assumptions.

Overall, if you are a fan of horror anthologies this one offers some good stories and avoids the clichéd and obvious. Even if you aren’t, if it is a light week at your Local Comic Shop and you have a spare $4 on you, then you could do considerably worse than give a new imprint a chance.</blockquote>"

<blockquote>Three tales of the creepy, twisted horrors of daily life from three Brits with an axe to grind . . . against our imaginations.

""Left Behind"" begins with Mark, recently dumped by his girlfriend Kristy. He has no idea why she’s gone, nor why she hasn’t taken her cat with her. Taking care of the cat allows him the feeling that she hasn’t left completely . . . until the cat runs off. He follows, believing those ""That’s Incredible"" stories about abandoned cats that travel thousands of miles to find their owners. But what he finds makes him wish he hadn’t. The perils of the supernatural aren’t Mark’s to deal with alone, however. A cabbie named Marty gets a bit of it, too, in ""Thirty Pieces,"" in which he picks up a very strange customer. Stranger still are the otherworldly beings chasing this man—just when it couldn’t get worse, it does as they turn into living skeletons of Roman centurions on horseback. But the kicker comes when the ride is over and Marty gets paid. Getting paid is what it’s all about in ""The Exchange,"" in which a family down on its luck and cash agree to sell something very dear to them.

Japanese horror flicks and the American adaptations they’ve inspired, like The Ring and Dark Water, work so well on our innate fears because they are grounded in the everyday. This is the vantage point from which Monkeys With Machineguns #1: Making Deals With Devils approaches its stories, yet the stories provided for this review have varying degrees of success.

The weakest, it terms of both story and art is ""Thirty Pieces."" The strengths of Mark Smith’s rough hewn artwork—mood setting, emotional reactions, and solid framing—unfortunately do not overcome its weaknesses—a sometimes too loose, other times too stiff approach to anatomy, and work that in general seems two or three degrees from looking ""professional."" But perhaps the biggest weakness of the art has more to do with the choice of picking this particular artist for this particular kind of story. Smith produces a great panel here and there, but overall, his art style isn’t a great fit for the script’s tone. More to the point, the artwork’s lack of polish subtracts from the sense of drama and suspense needed to pull off the big truth at the center of the story. But that itself is a problem, as the big truth is amateurishly telegraphed by little things in Chris Lynch’s writing, such as the title itself and a ""mysterious"" customer who looks way too much the part. However, even if these scripting hiccups could be expunged, where the writing shows its deeper weakness is the lack of something at stake. Marty drives like he’s in an action movie, and he gets paid in the end, but there’s no sense at all that something of real value has been won or lost.

Somewhere in the middle is the first story, ""Left Behind."" Stu.Art’s work here is quite strong, at once capable of conveying the lead character’s feelings of isolation, loneliness, desperation, and confusion after being dumped, then switching gears to depict the horrors that await as the story moves towards its conclusion. Unfortunately, Lynch’s writing isn’t up to the artwork. It does a great job of pulling us in and gaining our sympathies for the lead, and it also does a great job of not showing its hand as it does with ""Thirty Pieces."" However, for all the strong buildup, the twist ending is more ridiculous than horrifying. The point trying to be made is lost on the reader purely because of poor third act dialog and the lack of a believable reason why what happens happens. As a result, the ending comes out of nowhere and leaves the reader scratching his head.

It’s good showmanship to save the best for last. Fortunately, the minds behind Monkeys With Machineguns feel the same way, as ""The Exchange"" has none of the problems of the previous stories. In fact, it’s quite chilling on several levels. First, Lynch’s scripting does a great job of making this tale feel like it happens everyday. Second, given the pace of scientific advance, it also feels so possible. And third, like really good sci-fi, it sheds light on the present through scenarios set in the future or an alternate present. In this case, the light is a damning critique about the intersection of technology and capitalism, but, to his credit, Lynch keeps the critique on the down-low as the story grinds its way to a conclusion that would make Rod Serling squirm. Stu.Art’s hard black and whites, an expressionistic take on grotesque realism, is a strong compliment to Lynch’s writing for the way it strikes the tone of low-level fright the story needs, then builds on it.

Monkeys With Machineguns may have a number of flaws, but they are the missteps of creators who are still learning the craft. At least two of them have real promise, and one of them can be a fantastic artist if he gets scripts that are up to his level.</blockquote>"

<blockquote>Monkeys with Machineguns #1 is an exciting new title that contains four separate stories unified by a common general theme. In this first edition that theme is the notion of making deals with devils. This British horror anthology is a well produced little gem of a comic. The pairing of Stu Art’s dark and often grotesque art with the twisted storylines of Lynch is very effective and makes for a very satisfying if unsettling read.

This edition kicks off with Left Behind and initially this seems to be a story of a jilted lover as we observe the despair of a man left heartbroken and confused by the sudden departure of his loved one. It is only when he follows her cat in the hope that it will lead him to her that the story takes a more sinister turn. Lynche’s writing is very reminiscent of Roald Dahl at his most macabre. The skill is in the sudden, gruesome twist that turns the reader around with narrative punch that they never saw coming. Another noticeable aspect of Lynche’s writing throughout Monkeys with Machineguns #1 is his mastery of dialogue. Short, direct and realistic he has pruned his writing back to the bare bones without losing the ability to create believable characters through his careful choice of words

I am not sure that the whole talking animal thing is entirely convincing but there is no doubting the careful and well managed structure inherent in this opening tale. Stu Art’s art is a perfect compliment to this tale of horror. It is bold and definite with a heavy use of black that adds a definite sense of gloom. The very angular style gives a visual sharpness and adds to the tenseness that Lynche’s narrative sets up so well.

The title of the second story 30 Pieces should clue in anyone who has even the most rudimentary knowledge of Jesus Christ’s final hours.
This tale places a Jesus look alike in a modern London cab being pursued by skeletal Roman legionnaires. The art work here is not as bold but nevertheless it still works well with Lynche’s intriguing storyline. The ending is a little rushed and it is easy to miss the whole ‘who is Judas’ issue, so I advise readers just to slow down on the final page. The real highpoint of this story however is the cab driver character, a thoroughly believable rogue, the evil glint in his eye warns us early on that there is more to him than is initially apparent.

The most successful story though is the third titled The Exchange again this is an example of the story with a twist. We are led to believe that we are reading a story about a real estate sale when the reality is far less wholesome. In this story the art work splendidly works to unsettle and warn us. The grotesque caricatures, desolate expressions and graphic close ups of eating all work towards unnerving us, we know all is not well but we are just not sure what the truth is.

The fourth story is a prose chapter of an ongoing Victorian tale. Well written but I couldn’t help feeling it would have made a damned good comic. The only real concern I have is the cover. The art work is great but the muted colours and layout design that verges on the cluttered means that I fear this commendable comic could get lost on the shelves of many a comic book store. Overall then this is the kind of comic that makes you snigger in a maniacal way to yourself as you read it. Delightfully disturbed.

In a Word: Confident</blockquote>"

<blockquote>It struck me that we’ve been talking to British comics creators this month, telling you about the ones who we’re now representing on our webstore, talking to editors and so on, but I haven’t actually posted a review. Well, since Chris Lynch of the wonderfully monikered Monkeys With Machineguns press kindly sent me a PDF of Making Deals With Devils, their second collection, it’s time to change that.

Making Deals with Devils manages to pack four short, creepy tales into its 36 pages. The tone is set right from the cover, with its skeletal Roman soldier, which has a fine Mike Mignola quality to it I thought (no bad thing since Mignola is one of the best). Each tale is relatively short, but this seems to be no impediment to Chris and partner Stu.art creating a suitably menacing atmosphere, which the heavy-ink, black and white artwork suits perfectly.

Left Behind starts with a man, Mark, in dazed despair, wondering why his partner Kirsty has left him. Slumped dejectedly among packing boxes he muses on why she would leave him, what he did wrong and why she left her cat behind. What looks like being a morose tale of a jilted lover soon takes a more macabre turn when Mark follows the cat hoping to be lead to Kirsty. Again the artwork reminds me a bit of Mignola here, or Steve Parkhouse’s moody style in Angel Fire, while the dialogue is suitably grim:

<em>“There’s something about being left. It’s like finding out you were broken, faulty, when you thought you were working. Suddenly everything inside you feels sour and hollow like a dead fruit.”</em>

Which isn’t to say there isn’t some knowing humour in this collection too, spooky and disturbing as it is. For example, Mark complains that nothing works in the flat, even the knives won’t cut – eyeing the view outside he comments “I guess suicide’s out the window then.” In Thirty Pieces that humour is again evident in a tale of a cab driver suddenly overtaken by supernatural events. Crowded and pursued by spectral Roman soldiers on horseback after picking up the wrong fare, our cabby gets a mite ticked off and decides to sort out these soldiers from beyond, swerving into them. When his passenger screams at him, demanding to know what the hell he’s doing our cabby replies “same thing I’ve been doing for twenty years – driving like I own the road.” There’s a line from someone who has obviously read his fair share of A Cab Driver Writes in Private Eye.

The Exchange looks to be a straightforward tale of people selling their home, moving on, changing their lives. It is only as the tale progresses that the reader’s suspicions are raised that there is more going on here than a simple real-estate transaction, with the growing menace aided by some nice touches in the artwork, such as a close-up of an old lady’s face, flecked with cake crumbs, which is very disturbing (although damned if I can articulate exactly why, it just is). I can’t really say much more about this one without blowing the ending, but it reminded me very much of the sort of short tale Robert Silverberg used to conjure (again that is a compliment).

The printed version contains a fourth story which I haven’t seen yet, with Wrathbones, the Macabre Machiavelli from Issue #0, now back in the early period of the French Revolution dealing with a desperate nobleman in Deathbeds and Heirlooms. All in all I thought this was a cracking little collection, trading mostly in creepy atmosphere and twists rather than simple gory horror. Much as I enjoyed a nice bit of horror gore from time to time, it is the more atmospheric tale which sticks more effectively in your mind and returns unbidden in the small dark hours of the night when you hear a scratching at the window. I think this will appeal to anyone who enjoyed Angel Fire, Mike Mignola’s work or short spooky tales like those by E.F. Benson. And at a mere £2.39 it is a pretty affordable chance to take, so why not give it a bash?</blockquote>"

<blockquote>Monkeys with Machine Guns sounds as though it should be an anthropomorphic book, but it isn’t. With a title like that though there was obviously no way I wasn’t going to buy it – the choosing of the name alone should win an award for marketing.

This is an anthology title featuring five slightly macabre stories by the writer Chris Lynch. There’s a very black sense of humour at play here, but also a sense of the poignant and a masterful ability to manipulate the reader’s emotions. There’s real skill and (not to sound too pretentious but I can’t think of another way to put it) real craft on display. The middle story in particular was heart achingly sad.

Art is mostly supplied by Stu.art (which I assume is a pseudonym) and is pleasingly chunky. Presented in stark black and white, with nothing so indecisive as shades of grey Stu.art’s pages are reminiscent of Dave McKean’s linework, although there’s a slightly more raw quality which really works with the brutalist writing from Lynch.

Sitting in the middle of the book though, almost as a sorbet to clear the reader’s palette, is a six page story illustrated by Dark Smith (another pseudonym I suspect) which visually couldn’t be more different. Smith employs a much finer line, and leaves whole areas of the panel empty, presenting a more delicately structured panel, suggestive of Mobieus in may ways. Once again the art is perfectly suited to the script, and whoever decided which artist should handle the art chores on which story was either an editing genius or a really really lucky git.

Monkeys with Machine Guns (which so far as I can tell is the name of both the publishing house and the comic itself) oozes confidence at you. It’s every bit as slick as ballsy as something like Blair Witch, with the twists in the tale packing a real emotional punch. Like all good horror, Lynch also has something to say amidst the chills, making this a thought, as well as fear, provoking read.</blockquote>"

<blockquote>"" I was even happier to see a new issue from the Monkeys with Machineguns. Following on from last year’s excellent #0, we are now presented with a fully fledged issue #1. I have no idea why last year’s wasn’t #1, and this year’s isn’t #2 – it may be something to do with counting on your fingers when you lack opposable thumbs.

Who cares? It’s another rollicking good read.

Those of you who read my review of the last issue might remember that every issue of this menacingly monochrome anthology is intended to have a theme. The theme this year is “Making Deals with Devils”, and we are presented with four tales with radically different takes on this Faustian idea.

The scripts have all oozed from the pen of writer (and Fool’s Errand poster) Chris Lynch, who has lost none of the unnerving ability to mess with your head he exhibited in the previous issue. His first tale, Left Behind is illustrated in starkly contrasting black and white by Stu.Art (who can also be found occasionally on the Fool’s Errand boards) and is somewhat reminiscent of the old Roald Dhal Tales of the Unexpected. A man sits alone in the flat he used to share with his girlfriend. He came home three days ago to find her and half her stuff gone. Everything else was packed in boxes and he hasn’t seen her since.

Where has she gone? How will he find her? And how come she didn’t take the cat?

I’m a cat person. This one made me shiver…

The second story, Thirty Pieces, made me laugh. A London Cabbie stops to help a bedraggled man in the street. A man who, it turns out, is being pursued by all manner of demonic hordes. A man who tries to pay using Roman silver coins. Yeah, OK, so it’s a simple set up, but it’s amusingly told with a dry wit and a sly smile. And I’m sure I’ve been in that bloke’s cab y’know. This is the only story not illustrated by Stu.Art’s high contrast brush, and Mark Smith’s softer more organic shading suits the style of the story perfectly – an object lesson in the art and importance of matching script to art style. I can think of a few editors who could do to learn such good judgement.

The third story will be familiar to anyone who ever had to buy a house, and the final tale is a beautifully macabre prose tale in the tradition of Edgar Allen Poe.

The whole shebang is a masterpiece of monkey business – a striking simian success, a perfection of primate prose. I love it. I read my copy sitting outside in the dark of night with a beer to hand and The Mission on my mp3 player. An owl flew over my head somewhere in the middle of Thirty Pieces - something that never happens when I read Stephen King. Could more proof of the power of this comic be required?</blockquote>"

Flash is required, but as a mechanism for delivering high resolution pages (absolutely essential for a comic portfolio, even as a writer) My eBook looks pretty hard to beat. My new portfolio includes artwork from the immensely talented Stu.Art, Christian Ward, and Mark Smith."

Written for Mr and Mrs Meanie, sometime ago, whilst signing in Comic Guru.
<blockquote>""So, how does it work again?"" asked Helena, nervously sipping her latte.

The technician didn't look up from the machine, a Victorian nightmare of cogs, gears, sprokets and springs.

""I mean ... biologically ..."" Helena continued, ""Is it even possible?""

""No,"" grunted the technician, ""I spend eight hours before every shoot tuning this thing for it NOT to work.""

Helena shuffled her feet. She had done it all, so she thought, seen it all, and had it done to her again. Somehow though, this small, greasy man with this machine made her nervous. Even fully clothed, he made her nervous.

""And how DOES it work?"" she asked weakly.

The technician lifted his two ended screwdriver like a conductor's baton.

""You,"" he said, ""Here.""

The baton landed on something that looked like two seats fighting each other.

""The rooster,"" the technician continued, ""Here.""

The baton landed on what appeared to be a tube with bicycle clips attached.

""That's a weird stage name,"" said Helena.

""Yeah,"" grunted the technician, ""Whatever.""</blockquote>"

Moving this site from Drupal 4.x to Wordpress 2.7, I was obviously concerned with losing indexation of my old Drupal URLs from search engines.

As I had not set up clean URLs on my Drupal website for a lot of my content, I needed a quick and easy way of ensuring that any traffic destined for one of my Drupal pages firstly found it's way to the original content (as not everything has moved over to the new site) and secondly informed my users that the site had been moved.

Enter the 301 redirect, the safest way to redirect both users and search engines.

As I was not using clean URLs, the majority of my Drupal hits where coming in the form <em>http://www.planetofthepenguins.com?<strong>q=node/...</strong> <strong>. </strong></em>It's the <strong>q=</strong> that's key - Wordpress doesn't use this parameter and so I can safely assume that when I see it, it means the browser wanted a page from the old site.

So, having pointed <a href=""http://old.planetofthepenguins.com"">a new subdomain (http://old.planetofthepenguins.com)</a> at my old Drupal site, the code to perform the automatic redirection is simple ...
<blockquote>&lt;?php
$drupalq = $_GET['q'];
if ($drupalq){
header(""Status: 301 Moved Permanently"");
header(""Location:http://old.planetofthepenguins.com?q="" . $drupalq);
exit;
}
?&gt;</blockquote>
This code
<ol>
	<li>Grabs the ""q"" parameter from the URL into a variable</li>
	<li>Checks this variable and <em>if</em> it has been set</li>
	<li>Writes a 301 redirect to the HTTP return header</li>
	<li>Writes a location into the HTTP return header</li>
	<li>Prevents the rest of the page from being rendered</li>
</ol>
All that remains now is to put a prominent message on my old site that I have moved to a new platform and provide my users with a link to click.

Oh, and set up my Permalinks in Wordpress!"

We knew he wasn’t dead.

We didn’t like the seaside because everyone stared at us. At home,
people were too polite to stare, or point, or whisper as we passed. There were too many sideshows and fun fairs at the sea-front.

Everyone thought that we were part of the attractions.

The last time we ever went, mother took us to the edge of the sea late at night. She said we were there to meet Father. He lived in the sea.

They had no carrier bags.</strong>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Or, at least, that's what they told <em>me</em>. Because I suspect something more, something sinister. I suspect that Tesco are up to something, and I suspect the other shops are up to it as well.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">I believe I have uncovered the tyrannical conspiracy of Bags for Life.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">So, time to blow the theory.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>True Fact #1: Shops are not making you pay for carrier bags to help you.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><a title=""It's true, the Daily Mail said so"" href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-519870/Banish-Bags-Used-minutes-1-000-years--The-life-cycle-plastic-bags.html"" target=""_blank"">The approximate cost of a standard carrier bag is £0.005</a>. Therefore, when the shop charges you £0.05 for a bag, it is making a profit of 1000%. A healthy margin, in anyone's money.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Considering that, as a nation, we consume around 216 carriers <em>each</em> every year, that amounts to around an extra £10 that you personally will hand over.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Using even the <a title=""The 2001 Census."" href=""http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/commentaries/people.asp"" target=""_blank"">population of the UK in 2001</a>, that comes to a grand total of £520,420,000. That's half a billion pounds. Not quite enough to bail out a bank, but doesn't it beg the question of <a title=""If you want to find out, click here and do something"" href=""http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/what-you-can-do"" target=""_self"">what a real environment group could do with that sort of money</a>?</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">All this, of course, is for something that used to be free with any purchase. Plastic bags are not completely free (I would defy anyone to walk into a supermarket and walk about 200 bags gratis), but their cost is factoring into the running cost of the store.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">So, if I buy five items some proportion of the price of those items is not profit for the store or the original cost of the item to the store, but the overhead the store incurs to pay for the operations that enable me to buy it - the cashier, the till, the lights, the heating.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">And, a bag to put it all in. Unless, of course, you buy a ""Bag for Life"".</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>True Fact #2: Plastic Bags are already extremely durable, in fact, isn't that kind of the problem?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><a title=""Yep, the Daily Mail again. Still true."" href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-519870/Banish-Bags-Used-minutes-1-000-years--The-life-cycle-plastic-bags.html"" target=""_blank"">Scientists estimate that plastic bags take between 400 to 1,000 years to decay</a>. That''s not all though - a typical bag comprised of high density polyethylene can hold 22lbs of shopping, some can even hold double this amount. So, it's strong, durable, and will outlive me.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">And yet, this <em>isn't</em> a bag for life?</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The problem that the supermarkets tell us that they are trying to solve is the country's landfill sites filling up with indestrucible super bags. Their solution to this is to build a bag even more long lasting, even stronger, even more durable and then to <em>sell it to us</em>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">If you give me a plastic bag today and I look after it, care for it, and don't abuse it any unnatural way, it appears that there is every chance that I will be able to pass that plastic bag down to my as yet unborn children for them to use.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Of course, the logical response to this is ... ""But you're not <em>going</em> to look after that bag ... are you?""</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">And <em>that, </em>is what is wrong with bags for life.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>(Almost) True Fact #3: People are, generally, a bit rubbish</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">I've got lots of bags for life. They hang on doors. They are in the boot of my car. They are in my laptop case. Unlike The Organised People, however, I never seem to have one when I need one.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">So, when I get to the till and realise that I need bags, I now have to ask for them. This in itself would not be a major obstacle if the supermarkets hadn't, at some mysteriously appointed hour that was possibly under a full moon, trained all of their staff to look at you as if you had just confessed to child murder whenever you ask for a bag.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">All I want to do is put the stuff I am about to pay for in a bag so that I can take it home. Like a child with a garden full of the graves of dead pets, I <em>prommmise ... I'll look after this one</em>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">And that is the terrfiying thing. What if there are more people like <em>me</em> than there are Organised People? What if, rather than saving the planet by eliminating the ""threat"" of plastic bags, we had unleased a far more dangerous plague - mountains of Bags of Life, discarded by the likes of me, to clutter up the lives of the Organised People?</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">I wonder if, some day soon, I will stand at the counter and ask for a Bag for Life only to receive the same look of disdain currently reserved for the Baglass People like me, and perhaps be reminded that ""they last forever, you know ...""</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Or at least, for life. Which, according to scientists, is going to need to be more than 400 years for me to get my money's worth of even one of these bags.</p>

This year we are exhibiting with a twist however, as all our hard work on <a title=""Visit The Magpye Microsite"" href=""http://magpye.monkeyswithmachineguns.com/"">The Magpye</a> for <a href=""http://www.markosia.com"">Markosia</a> has left us without a brand new issue of our eponymous horror anthology to debut at the show. With the release of the latest MWM being somewhat of a Bristol tradition, at least for Stu and I, were left somewhat stumped this year as to what exactly to do ...

Thankfully, the answer is obvious. We would just write and draw a new issue of Monkeys with Machineguns <em>at</em> the Bristol Comic Expo!

Any of you who have attended one of my signings will be familiar with the setup - woefully unable to cede the limelight to artists and jealous of the constant requests they receive for sketches and shows and signings, I have gotten into the habit of writing flash fiction &amp; short stories at shows, often based on random words, phrases, objects etc. thrown at me (figuratively) by whoever is around. It's a sort of ""Whose Line is it Anyway"", but with horror fiction.

So, this year, visitors to the Small Press Expo will be cordially invited to challenge the creativity of the Monkeys with Machineguns team with some random objects, places, people, and points in time from which to create a short story. Once I've written the short, Stu will be providing a sketch illustration or two and, after we've scanned the result to go into the new book, you will be able to buy the original artwork.

By the end of the day we are hoping to have enough content to complete the upload to our POD publisher of all the stories and artwork, resulting in a brand new issue of Monkeys with Machineguns on sale at the end of the show.

So, if you have ever wondered exactly how we <em>make</em> Monkeys with Machineguns ... this is your chance to find out. Or watch us crash and burn horribly, which will probably be equally entertaining.

<strong>How to Find Yourself some MWM Goodness</strong>

For those who don't know, the expo this year is a special one off version of the event that will be spread across two venues. The ""Bristol International Comic Expo"", which will be held exclusively in the Ramada Plaza hotel this year, and the the ""Small Press Expo"", which will be held in the Mercure Hotel. If you have been to the Bristol Expo before then you may well know the Ramada as the hotel that has hosted many of the talks and panels for previous shows, as well as being where most of the comic book fraternity do their socialising after the event.

The Monkeys with Machineguns table will be the Mercure, hopefully with a loud crowd around it and limited screaming from Stu and myself.

Please note that the Small Press Expo is a one day event only. Stu and I will be lurking around in the Ramada based Expo on Sunday, but don't expect us to write and draw anything unless you come with gifts. Or cash."

Oh dear oh dear.

I have received some comment spam today that I found so amusingly clumsy that I have decided it deserves something more than my usual ""hit the spam button in Wordpress and sigh"" response.

Today, we have our inaugural member of the Planet of the Penguins Roll of Shame.

<strong>Congratulations <a title=""Click this link to share in their shame"" href=""http://www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com"" target=""_blank"">www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com</a></strong>

The spam comment was attached to my article ""<a href=""2009/02/03/how-to-haikuhow-to-haiku/"">How To Haiku</a>"" and ran as follows:
<blockquote>This might be a little off subject, but have you looked at seoclientprospectingrobot dot com? Just wondering if you have any reviews of it, I’m thinking of buying a copy, and wanted to see if anyone had bought a copy yet.</blockquote>
OK, so what's wrong with this piece of comment spam and why do think it is particularly worthy of ridicule?
<ol>
	<li>""It might be a little off subject""

Yes, it certainly is. About forty thousand leagues away from the actual topic of the post in fact. There is no conceivable link between the post and the comment. This is either lazy spamming or spamming that tried <em>not</em> to be lazy but went very, very wrong when confronted with my post.

Somewhere between 0 and 5 out of 10 for effort, 0 out of 10 for effectiveness <strong><a title=""Click this link to share in their shame"" href=""http://www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com"" target=""_blank"">www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com</a>.
</strong></li>
	<li>It is using ""black hat"" SEO techniques to advertise SEO software that may or may not itself be sporting a dark chapeau

Spamming blogs that allow public comments, like this one, is a common ""black hat"" SEO practice; designed to inject links into sites and thus increase the page rank and perceived relevance of the target site. Search engine spiders see the link, or mention of the link, from my site to <strong><a title=""Click this link to share in their shame"" href=""http://www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com"" target=""_blank"">www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com</a> </strong>and then count that as a ""vote"" for that site, improving its search engine position.

Spam links, therefore, attempt to abuse this very democratic system of links=votes by creating links automatically.
<strong><a title=""Click this link to share in their shame"" href=""http://www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com"" target=""_blank"">
</a></strong>So<strong>, </strong>I have to say there is a certain irony in finding a spam comment that is trying to improve the search engine position of a web page about software that ... improves your search engine position. Irony, and no small amount of annoyance. Nice try <a title=""Click this link to share in their shame"" href=""http://www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com"" target=""_blank""><strong><a title=""Click this link to share in their shame"" href=""http://www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com"" target=""_blank"">www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com</a></strong></a></li>
</ol>
So, not a very good effort overall. Really ... quite, quite poor.

I must point out at this point in time that I don't know if the software available from <strong><a title=""Click this link to share in their shame"" href=""http://www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com"" target=""_blank"">www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com</a> </strong>was used to commit this crime against intelligence<a title=""Click this link to share in their shame"" href=""http://www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com"" target=""_blank"">,</a> or if perhaps it was the work of someone else. <a href=""mailto:seo4u@live.com"">You would have to ask Sophie, via seo4u@live.com</a>, who originally posted the comment. Allegedly.

Best of luck in your next job Sophie.

Chris out.

I knew this some time back and it was at the front of my mind when I penned the short ""The Clockwork Occultist"", which I am delighted to be able to let you know will be included in this anthology. Victoriana is a favourite theme/meme of mine, so I'm pretty chuffed to be the first out of the gate with something for the 2011 Accent book, which will no doubt continue to be a ""who's who"" of UK talent.

""The Clockwork Occultist"" is a tale of Victorian time travel, steam powered legs, very big guns, a hero, a villian, vampires, and Hitler ... <em>steampunk </em>Hitler ... being ably illustrated by a new partner in crime Terry Cooper. Terry has kindly sketched out page 1 for us, complete with some dialog to whet the appetite ...

So, without further ado ...
<blockquote><strong>Terry Cooper</strong> was born nearly 40 years ago in an ambulance in North London. He moves to Wales in 1980 and did whatever he could to get through his schooling alive.

He had a short but fruitful career in the 1990s as a member of the rap group, 'Best Shot', touring the UK with East 17.

Nowadays, he is a full-time artist and illustrator, producing everything from storyboards, cartoon characters and company logos to book and CD
covers. In addition, he is a published novelist with the book, 'KANGAZANG!' and is currently writing the sequel. He also writes a fortnightly column for the local press.

If that wasn't enough, he also runs a computer animation studio, Strangetown Animation, and provides voice-overs and narration for advertisements, films and cartoons. Terry has two children, but is single (ladies!) and lives in Pontypridd.</blockquote>

I have been using <a href=""http://celtx.com/"">Celtx </a>to write my comic book scripts for quite some time now, and find one of its most useful features to be the ability to keep character, prop, and scene information seperate from the main body of the script but with hyperlinks to move to and from the script. Celtx also allows you to attach notes and annotations to elements of your script.

As with any piece of software however, there are drawbacks, and my key gripe with Celtx is that you can't easily redefine the templates for characters, props, scenes, etc. Whilst the software is quite well optimsed for movie production, filling in the little forms isn't really suitable or applicable to creating a comic book.

This prompted me to explore the notion of using a Wiki to write my scripts - free from the constraints imposed by Celtx's formatting and functionality, but with all the functionality to create links between points in the script and additional information.

I knew I wanted a file based Wiki, probably using Javascript, that had no requirement for a server install. I also knew that I wanted it to be open source, so that I could change it if I wanted to and support it if I had to. I had a thought that possibly <a href=""http://www.tiddlywiki.com/"">TiddlyWiki </a>was what I needed, but no ideas beyond that.

Enter <a href=""http://www.wikimatrix.org/""><strong>WikiMatrix</strong></a>. 

WikiMatrix is a fantastic site that documents the functionality of all the major Wiki platforms, both closed and open source, and provides a comparison matrix that can be used to compare features and functionality.

Possibly its more powerful feature is the ability to select a Wiki using a wizard based series of questions, providing you with statistics as you answer each question as to how many wikis you have discounted with each answer.

Predictably, TiddlyWiki came back as the obvious answer for me, but WikiMatrix also threw up a number of other options that are all worthy of investigation before I settle on what might be my new writing platform.

So, whilst I may or may not be changing platform from my beloved Celtx, I will certainly be returning to WikiMatrix."

I've tossed my hat into the ring, although with my track record of killing ""comic jams"" dead with my overuse of the word ""betwixt"" (long story, for another post), who knows if I will get to be one of the monkeys in question?"

Looks like I made the cut for the <a href=""http://monkeyonmyback.squarespace.com/twitter-comic/"">Monkey On My Back Twitter Comic</a>. Check out panel #10 for something typically MWM.

Wasn't entirely sure how this would work, both practically and in terms of the way the story would break down, but there is certainly something interesting happening.

What I would love to see is this being done on a larger scale now - with every response Tweet getting an illustration and creating a divergent path in the story. That sort of meta-fiction fascinates me, andI think it would be amazing to see the different storylines expand, cross, converge, and even merge towards the end.

I've been thinking about trying to build some kind of overall narrative into the <a href=""http://www.tinyurl.com/mwmlive"">Monkeys with Macineguns Live!</a> event based on this. I'm not sure if it will be possible, but certainly we'll be Twittering throughout the day, so if you can't make it to the show itself, be sure to <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/chrislynch_mwm"">follow us on Twitter</a> and see how we get on."

<strong>MONKEYS WITH MACHINEGUNS OFFER A VISION OF THE FUTURE AT BRISTOL COMIC CON
</strong>
Monkeys with Machineguns are producing an extremely limited number of promotional comic books to accompany the Monkeys with Machineguns Live event at the Small Press Expo in Bristol on May 9th.

While stocks last anyone buying a unique, one off illustrated short story from Chris and Stu will receive it mounted inside a copy of the limited edition twenty page book. Featuring not only an eight page preview of their upcoming book “The Magpye”, being published by Markosia, but also a full colour eight page preview of a brand new secret project, this is an opportunity for those taking part in Monkeys with Machineguns Live to own a small part of the future of comic book history.

For those not in the know, the Magpye is a “supernatural superhero psychological horror story”, a genre-bending tale of an amnesiac vigilante charged with defending mankind from monsters, creatures, and things that lurk in the dark whilst being haunted, and sometimes hounded, by the ghosts of his fallen predecessors. When the Magpye’s identity is finally revealed however, he may have to face the worst monster of all … himself.

As for the secret project … the details of that will be revealed at the show!"

Cy Dethan is a man with his finger on the pulse so when he says ""<a href=""http://theraggedman.blogspot.com/2009/04/beware-its-future-it-will-burn-you.html"">Beware! It's the Future - It Will Burn You!</a>"", I have to prick up my ears (or, as this the internet my eyes) and listen (read).

What Cy's posting about is the publication of some Markosia back catalogue stuff via iTunes as an iPhone application and the future publication of the same to Google Android phones, Blackberrys etc. in the near future. Very exciting stuff, especially when you get your head around the size of this market place and how accessible the content becomes when it this these platforms.

I had intended to download Beowulf #1 as a trail and tell you how good it was but, sadly, I can't. I do not own an iPhone or an iPod. I own a Nokia 5800, which is technically far superior, sexier, does more, but lacks access to iPhone applications. When iPhone applications where just glorified web pages and calculators for working out your share of a bill, I didn't care. But now the iPhone has comics, and thusly I am <em>vexed</em>. I also maybe have to rethink my comments about accessibility, but that's a job for another time.

So, no free content for me. Until I buy an iPod Touch, I guess."

My days of having to clear somwhere in the region of 100 spam comments out of my blog every day are gone. I have finally implemented a ""captcha"" on the comment form, thus disbarring all bots, robos, script kiddies, and general spamming malcontents. If you want to offer me a larger penis, perkier breasts, or a longer last erection you will now need to do it in person, or at the very least read the captcha.

There are a number of captcha modules available for Wordpress. I went for <a href=""http://blog.zorex.info/?page_id=2"">Simple CAPTCHA</a> , as a simple, ""no frills"" option. Installation is nothing more than FTP-ing the files to your plugins directory and switching it on. Instant captcha, instant zero pending comments for me.

More MWM Live practice. This time I try to fit Hitler, a museum, and a monkey covered in jam onto one side of A5.
<blockquote>It is a little known fact that Hitler maintained a secret museum, three storeys below his bunker in the heart of Berlin. At first, it was home to the ransacked treasures of the nations crushed under the Nazi jackboot but, as the war came towards its end and Hitler's mania for the esoteric and the occult reached its height, the museum became home to artifacts and relics of a very different nature.

On the final night of the war, it was Private Klaus Gunderson who held the keys to the museum. Loyal to the end, he believed it to be the safest place in all of Berlin. And so, naturally, he brought his wife and child there, sure that the Feurer would approve. She was good, Arian stock, their child a blond haired, blue eyed boy.

He walked with them both through the cramped aisles of the private museum, their small talk designed to drown out the sounds of bombardment and fighting from above, but failing miserably.

“What's that?” asked Klaus' wife, pointing a shadowy, hunched figure in the darkness.

“That is a stuffed monkey from the court of Louis the Sixteenth of France. We liberated it from the Bastille.”

“It has been ... mutilated?”

“Louis had his private surgeon stitch bladders into the creature so that he could be breast fed his favourite foods by it. When we took it from them, the French had it full of jam.”

“Amazing. And how about this?”

Klaus took the bottle from his wife and studied it carefully. “I believe we took this from the body of a British spy.”

He turned the bottle over in his hands. Although his English was not terribly good, he could read the simple inscription.

“Drink me ...”

With a thunderous crash, something hit the bunker from above. Boxes toppled in the museum, throwing up a thick cloud of dust.

Klaus could hear shouting from upstairs, and splashing noises. Someone shouted something about kerosene, and that the Feurer must not be captured, no matter what the cost.

“What should we do?” asked Klaus' wife.

Klaus took a last look at his wife, uncorked the bottle, and drank.</blockquote>"

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;""> She looked at the sturdy gunmetal grey telephone case. She gingerly lifted up the handset.

We can choose to continue paying the interest, or we can pay down the principal by refactoring the quick and dirty design into the better design. Although it costs to pay down the principal, we gain by reduced interest payments in the future.”</span></em></span></blockquote>
And, like any of Wes' inspirational and though provoking emails - this got me thinking ...

I have believed for some time that good writing and good computer programming are very alike. They both require structure, consistency, an an absence of holes that bleed logic until the whole thing collapses in on itself.

So, just as you should have a plan before you have a programme, shouldn't you have a plot before you have that first paragraph?<em> And what if you're a comic book?</em>

Comic books from the ""Big Three"" are constantly under pressure from continuity. Characters created in the 1940s must somehow be made relevant to today, but without invalidating any of the storytelling that has gone before. Not only do you have the emotional history of the character to deal with, to avoid an inevitable clamouring of ""he wouldn't do that"" when you mistep, but you also have the legions of fans who know every stat, every fictional fact, and every immeasurable measure that there is to know about their favourite characters. There are people out there who know how much Superman can lift. Precisely.

As a writer, I have no time for anyone who has no time for continuity. Writing comic books means buying into that pantheon, that history, that shared experience that existing before you and will probably outlive you. DC may own the trademark and the copyright to Superman, but can they really claim to control the character? By now, hasn't Superman transcended the bounds of the comic book page, the movie theatre, the TV screen, and become a part of our culture? I believe he has and, if that's right, then DC have nothing more than the most tenuous legal argument to the ""ownership"" of Superman.

If you ask me, Superman belongs to the kid in the red blanket and extra pair of underpants, running around his garden and saving the world from imagined plots by Lex Luthor and Brainiac. As it should be with stories, as it should be with myths.

As part of what some people might consider a ""new generation"" of comic book writers, I aspire to create something that can not only escape the narrow walls of fiction that I create for it, but can also outlive me and find a life for itself in the real world. I want there to be kids in blankets pretending to be my characters, fighting my villians, and all the while oblivious to even the notion of my existence.

And perhaps, just perhaps, it will happen. And on the off-chance it will, shouldn't I be engineering a little longevity into my creations?

Hence, I've started to consider the nature of ""plot debt"". If I don't construct characters <em>now</em> with the right amount of resonance, with the right mix of pathos and accessibility, can I ever hope or expect for them to be anything other than temporary constructs within the boundaries of a single story? If they are going to survive in the big, wide, world, don't they need to be built that way?"

For anyone who hasn't already heard, <a href=""http://http://www.hasbro.com/resolute/en_US/"">GI Joe Resolute</a> is an eleven episode animated series based on the 'Joe franchise written by UK scribe Warren Ellis.

Originally broadcast on the [adult swim] network, this is certainly a more mature take on the franchise, the cartoon that adult fans of the 'Joe franchise will no doubt refer to as ""The GI Joe Cartoon we've been waiting for"".

Having seen the trailers for the new ""Rise of Cobra"" 'Joe movie, and eyed the ""accelerator suits"" with some suspicion (unless it leads to a GI Joes/Transformers crossover movie that is), I thought I'd make sure that anyone who hasn't stumbled across Resolute has it as an example of what the 'Joes can do.

Michael Jackson's Last Audience.#
I have just lived through a bizarre experience, watching news of Michael Jackson's death propogate across the Internet in real time.

I saw the news first on Twitter, where microbloggers tweeted and retweeted the news that had been broken on the TMZ website. Whilst traditional media, such as BBC News 24, tried to confirm the story, I was able to watch it metamorphose into something else time and again.

As I write this, the news has just broken on the BBC, the first news source that I trust enough to believe it. I have also had four messages that he is not dead, two that he is in a coma, one that it is a publicity stunt, and eight jokes (none funny). Some people praise, others decry. I am sorry to say, a few celebrate in a manner that tries to disguise ghoulish glee for a moral compass.

A friend has just IM-ed me to tell me that the Wikipedia page has already been updated. I have no doubt the eBay auctions are already being set up to auction off tickets to concerts that will now never play.

All of which makes me wonder something ...  is this the way that the worth of our lives will be measured in future; not by the deeds we do, but by the tweets and blog posts about us when we are gone?

I have 296 Facebook friends. I worry that this is not enough of a legacy."

After yesterday's post about the <a href=""2009/07/02/youtube-o-m-g-i-g-p-internet-explorer-8-puke-vomit-girl/"">vomit inducing Microsoft advert</a>, I couldn't help but mention that other piece of (evil) marketing genius from Redmond for Internet Explorer 8 that has hit the press today.

<strong>If you <a href=""http://www.browserforthebetter.com"">download Internet Explorer 8</a>, Microsoft will donate eight meals to the ""<a href=""http://feedingamerica.org/default.aspx"">Feeding America</a>"" campaign.</strong>

Internet news sites are already awash with commentary regarding Microsoft's ""download IE 8 or a child starves"" approach, with a saddening number of responses from some Internet malcontents that Americans don't need any additional feeding. For once, I'm not going to add grist to the mill of sarcasm. Somewhere, there is either a pretty bad person or a pretty good person behind this and, although the effort may seem a little misguided and will probably be viewed as at least a misfire if not a total backfire ..., it is still an easy way to give a little something to charity.

So, here's the plan
<ol>
	<li>Go to <a href=""http://www.browserforthebetter.com"">http://www.browserforthebetter.com</a></li>
	<li>Click the big ""download"" button</li>
	<li>Pick an operating system. Doesn't matter which one.</li>
	<li>When the option to download the file comes up, download it.</li>
	<li>You should be presented with a page confirming that 8 meals have been donated</li>
	<li>Wait for the download to finish and then delete the downloaded file</li>
</ol>
Microsoft only require you to download Internet Explorer 8 for them to donate the eight meals. They don't say that you have to install it.

<em>Only complete downloads of Windows® Internet Explorer® 8 through </em><a href=""http://www.browserforthebetter.com/"" target=""_blank""><em>browserforthebetter.com</em></a><em> from June 8, 2009 through August 8, 2009 qualify for the charitable donation to Feeding America®. Microsoft® is donating $1.15 per download to Feeding America® up to a maximum of $1,000,000. Meals are used for illustrative purposes only. Meal conversion is effective until June 30th, 2010.</em>

My only concern with my master plan is that the definition of a ""complete"" download involves installing the product and downloading more files in the process; the download is only 18Mb, which seems remarkably slim for a Microsoft application.

Still, I got to the thank you screen, I think that means my work is done.

So, what are you waiting for? Download (but feel no complusion to install) Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 today!

<blockquote>Lucky was found in a town close to Lake Malawi. Passers-by saw him tied to a tree in a market in the centre of a rubbish pit and called the sanctuary. Even though he was well fed, he had not been looked after properly. The rope and chain that tied him to the tree was too tight and dug into his skin. The team took him straight to the sanctuary, freed him from his rope and chains and within weeks, his injuries healed.

The first issue should be available digitally from August, with the remaining four issues out by the end of the year, with a graphic novel version in the works shortly after that.

There is a preview version online that you rate and comment upon:

<strong><a href=""http://www.thedarkcomicbook.com"">http://www.thedarkcomicbook.com</a></strong>

<strong><!--more--></strong>

The official press release now follows:
<blockquote>Markosia Enterprises have teamed up with Chris Lynch (Monkeys with Machineguns, Photonic Graffiti) and Rick Lundeen (100 Covers, Epoch) to publish “The Dark”.

The first issue of “The Dark” will be released in August of this year as a digital comic book, via iTunes, with three more issues in the pipeline. A graphic novel is planned for later in the year.

The Dark is the story of Daniel Abbot, a brilliant young scientist on the fringes of the establishment and the creator of Memetech  - a technology that encodes information and memories into a liquid form, allowing anyone to “drink” the information. Terrified that his invention will be used for military purposes he decides to destroy his research, but not before he takes one last trip ... with disastrous results.

Two years on, and the Memetech genie is out of the bottle. Abbot, having perfected his own version of the technology, fights a one-man war against the spread of his own invention and the collapse of our information culture in the guise of “The Dark”. Aided by an artificial intelligence nicknamed Howard Hughes, Abbott creates “The Baffler” – a coat made of Memetech that gives his the edge over his enemies. Capable of injecting information directly into this brain and firing Memetech flechettes to hit others with bursts of pure information, The Baffler is both weapon and disguise in Daniel Abbot's war against his own creation.

When The Dark uncovers a plot to set off Memetech bombs across the whole of the city Dante, filling the air with liquid information and creating a new society of his enemy's devising, The Dark is plunged into a desperate race against time.

But, not everything is what is seems. Who is the new and mysterious enemy who seems to know The Dark's every move?  How did the Memetech, thought destroyed, reappear? Why can't Daniel wake his wife and son? And why is everyone in Dante named after an English poet?

Publisher Harry Markos had this to say on securing the property for Markosia: “I’ve been a big fan of Chris Lynch for a while now and asked him to pitch a couple of new projects that we could look at for the digital market, with a view to releasing it as a graphic novel later. He has come up trumps with The Dark. Coupled with Rick’s fantastically atmospheric art, Chris’s story takes you to a very believable but disturbing world, not unlike the one we are living in at the moment! I am confident that we have a hit in the making.”</blockquote>"

The guys over at Sidekick Cast are the first take to take advantage of our reviewer's preview, and have given The Dark four stars!
<blockquote>When I started the first issue I thought 'Ok this seems like your standard dark avenger vigilate superhero story with a nice little sci-fi premise for the powers'. I was wrong. The main protagonist reads like the bastard love child of Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne with a hint of the tortured soul of Frank Castle. The idea of information as a weapon is taken to it's literal conclusion in this story and although it may seem like the stuff of science fiction I suspect Lynch has been flicking through the pages of The New Scientist as liquid information is one of the next big steps in digital information transfer. This is very much on the fringe of science-fact.

By the end of the book everything I thought I knew had been turned on it's head and I was totally sucked in.</blockquote>
It's great to see the book already going down well, and hopefully people reading the review will be inspired to pick up that all important first issue.

For some time I have been plauged by a slow (3-4 minute) startup window for Firefox.

I have tried numerous fixes suggested online; switching of automatic updates for extensions, clearing down cache and history, even a re-install; but nothing worked. As the problem got progressively worse, my workaround became to start Firefox and then, whilst I waited for it to grind into life, to start Google Chrome and use that to check Facebook, Twitter, etc. Not exactly a <em>fix</em>, but at least I didn't have to sit and wait as my HD rattled away and Firefox limped onto the screen.

However, I have now found a fix and, as I haven't seen this mentioned anywhere else, I thought I would share it for any others affected by this particular problem. I had archived this post as a draft, but after hearing others complaining of the same issue I thought I would post by solution.

My particular set up of Firefox is Firefox 3.5, on Vista Business, with XMarks, Firebug, and SEOQuake extensions (the essential tools of one of my trades!). I am also a bit of an RSS addict, and it was herein that lay the rub.

Somewhere in the combination of having an extensive list of Live Bookmarks and having an extension that syncs my bookmarks to the web (XMarks) lies a rich vein of process and network hungry action. Starting up Firefox seemed to necessitate a mass update of the Live Bookmarks and this may, or may not, have kicked off a lot of sync activity in XMarks.

My process of deduction here is by no means scientific, with the exception of having empirically tested this theorem by moving my RSS feeds to Google Reader.

My bookmarks are now Live Bookmark free, XMarks seems to be winking away a lot less in my Firefox status bar, and the browser now starts up just as fast as it ever did. Not <em>Chrome</em> fast, but still, a lot lot faster.

So, if you are having the same issue as me with a similar set-up, feel free to try this fix out."

I've been advocating <a href=""http://www.spotify.com"">Spotify</a> for some time now. As an audiophile of eclectic tastes it certainly suits me to have their enormous music collection at my fingertips and as a very late convert to the world of the iPod, the transportability of my settings and playlists supplemented my lack of a portable music player nicely for quite some time.

If you have not tried Spotify out, stop reading this post and go download it. It will change your view on digital music, or at the very least help you find <em>your new favourite band</em>.

For those still with me, the latest news is that Spotify have submitted an iPhone application to Apple's App Store for approval. Allegedly only available to premium subscribers, those paying Spotify £120 a year for free access to all music with no adverts, the application is demonstrated best by Spotify themselves.

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNCb1IdmJ_0&amp;feature=player_embedded"">Spotify iPhone Application demo</a>

The question that seems to abound on the 'net is whether this application will be approved by Apple ...

The approval process for the App Store does allow Apple to disbar any applications that are too similar in function to applications that are already being supplied with the device, ergo there is no point writing a new mail application, or a new calendar, unless you can deliver something markedly different. Will Apple use this clause as a reason to bar Spotify's application, a clear competitor to its own iTunes platform, or will it simply see it as another strong horse in the App Store stable?

Only time will tell, and we should know the result in the next few weeks.

Personally, I am routing for Spotify. Not only are my tastes wide, but they <em>change. </em>£120/year for unlimited music seems fair, that's less than the cost of an album a month. There are a lot of albums I would try out on a scheme like that, but far less that I would buy for £10 on the off chance they make it into my permanent rotation.

In the meantime, I'm back to my <a href=""http://open.spotify.com/user/thefictionalist/playlist/0bPRkCl7eXqFN7R3R0A5RQ"">Richard Cheese playlist</a>."

Managing an online presence or brand can be a challenge, but it is something that all writers need to do, particularly comic book writers who can reach out to a significant proportion of their fanbase online.

A typical online profile will consist of your own blog, a Facebook account, a Twitter account, and possibly a LinkedIn and/or MySpace account as well. You'll also have at least one email account to manage, more than one if you like to practice a little email partitioning.

If, like me, you were finding that managing your online presence across these multiple platforms was becoming a headache, then you should take time out to try <a href=""http://www.digsby.com""><strong>digsby</strong></a>

Digsby provides a Microsoft Messenger style interface to all of the above scenarios, with system tray icons and configurable pop-up ""balloons"" to alert you to activity on Facebook and Twitter. It's also a solid chat client for when you want to talk to any of your online contacts, providing a much better interface to the clunky Facebook chat if nothing else. It also provides a <a href=""http://widget.digsby.com/"">website widget</a> that you can install on your blog.

By combining all of your online presences into a single user interface and providing you with pop up notification of changes and activity, Digsby radically streamlines the process of managing a complex online identity or brand. Utilising Digsby, brand management and social networking are now something that I do in real time, in parallel with whatever task I am working on, as opposed to being something that requires one or more dedicated time slots during my day.

Patently, there is a security concern with using Digsby in that you need to store your account details on their server, protecting yourself behind a single Digbsy account password. For the moment, security breaches are nill. It is fair to say that only a single breach is required to kill of a project such as Digsby ... but for now they have a clean sheet.

In the interests of disclosure I will mention that Digsby now also have an <a href=""http://blog.digsby.com/archives/543"">Affiliate Program</a>, paying up to $1 for every new user. In the interests of staying as neutral as I can in this blog post, I am not currently signed up to this scheme. If you do download Digsby on my recommendation, please send your $1 to me direct ;-)"

Zaius of Escape from Tomorrow as reviewed the preview edition of The Dark, Issue 1.
<blockquote>I read the 8 page preview issue that Markosia have released and really enjoyed it. The writing was nicely paced and the dialogue felt real: the fight scenes had a real sense of danger whilst the opening panels, set in a hospital room as the scientist sits alongside his wife's bed, had a genuine feel of desperation, of regret. Likewise, the artwork was very much to my own personal taste - clean, confident, subtle colouring.

It seems to me Markosia have found an ideal approach here by releasing the single issues digitally and then following up with a printed volume. Based on the strength of this preview issue I would be happy to pay for the digital downloads and then buy the printed collected edition.</blockquote>

Writing Issue 3 of ""The Dark"" called for a plethora of new and nightmarish characters. I honestly did wonder what artist-extraordinary Rick Lundeen would make of some of my requests ...

Turns out, he's even sicker than I am.

Without further preamble, I proudly ... yes, <em>proudly</em> ... present two of the horrors that are being created for Issue 3 of The Dark.

<strong>Doctor Needles</strong>

The Doctor is in; part doctor, part dentist, part cyborg, and part giant spider. He is, basically, every childhood horror and nightmare that you ever had.

Just don't ask what Rick has hidden behind those glasses.

People tell me that all writers have moments of doubt, times when they wonder if their voice is ever really being heard or if they are just screaming out into a void that will never respond. The existential dread that contemplating this for too long can engender is almost beyond comprehension, a crippling, agonising state of almost blind panic as you question whether anything you do has any meaning.

I am proud to have added my name to those calling for the government for formally apologize for the prosecution of Alan Turing that many believe led to his untimely death by suicide.

I, like many, regard Alan Turing as a modern day hero. A genius, an athlete, a war hero, and the father of computer science as we know it today, Turing would be deserving of the recognition of his country and his countrymen even he had not been, by our modern sensibilities, brutalised and criminalised by the state that he loyally served. <em>(If you want to know about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing"">Turin, his Wikipedia entry</a> is excellent, or you could watch the marvelous <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ba6v7bahaU"">""Breaking the Code"" starring Derek Jacobi</a>)</em>.

I rarely agree with the notion of one generation apologising for the mistakes, transgressions, and sins of another. The apology seems somewhat hollow, an embarrased nod in the direction of culpability at best. We must accept, surely, that the accepted morality of any time has a ""sell by"" date and, as we move into what we believe to be a more understanding and compassionate world, it seems churlish to feel that we have to make amends for the mistakes of people living in a different time for whom the world would have seemed very different and for whom morality would have been very different indeed. By its very definition, the ""progress"" that makes our world better and brighter must make the past dimmer and darker by comparison. On the other hand, perhaps this objection is nothing more than a latent fear that someday some ancestor of mine will have to apologize for some transgression on my part, some poorly informed misjudgment that I make today with all good intentions.

<strong><a rel=""attachment wp-att-812"" href=""http://www.planetofthepenguins.com/2009/09/01/alan-turing-a-modern-day-hero/turing/""><img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-812"" style=""margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"" title=""Plaque at Turing's Home"" src=""http://www.planetofthepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/turing-263x300.gif"" alt=""Plaque at Turing's Home"" width=""263"" height=""300"" /></a></strong>Whatever the case, my rare agreement today exists that <em>something</em> should be done to formally honour Turing, who is without doubt one of the most important minds of the last 100 years and one of our most significant thinkers.

With this in mind, if I could control the form the apology would take, it would be as much needed funding for Bletchley Park, the place in which Turin achieved his greatest breakthroughs and with which he will forever be associated. That, or enough money to create an AI that would finally past the Turing Test.

And we shall call it Alan.

September 5th saw the launch of an exploit based attack on Wordpress blogs worldwide.

The warning comes from <a href=""http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2009/09/04/old-wordpress-versions-under-attack/"">Lorelle on WordPress</a> after it was discovered that the pernicious attack is exploiting security holes in previous versions of the blogging software, creating a new “hidden” Administrator account and penetrating right down to the database level.

The attacks are said to be “growing by the hour”. Lorelle writes:
<blockquote>There are two clues that your WordPress site has been attacked.

There are strange additions to the pretty permalinks, such as example.com/category/post-title/%&amp;(%7B$%7Beval(base64_decode($_SERVER%5BHTTP_REFERER%5D))%7D%7D|.+)&amp;%/. The keywords are “eval” and “base64_decode.”

The second clue is that a “back door” was created by a “hidden” Administrator. Check your site users for “Administrator (2)” or a name you do not recognize. You will probably be unable to access that account.</blockquote>
<strong>All users are advised to upgrade to the latest version of Wordpress immediately.</strong>

<strong></strong>Reports indicate that hacked sites are extremely difficult to repair. As the damage reaches all the way down to the database, a simple reinstall will leave the hack in place. The generally accepted remedy appears to be to export your content and to import it into a new, clean, installation. That means binding a fond farewell to your settings and configuration.

Endless emnity for the thoughtless protagonists behind all this aside, there is a heart-warming amount of support in the Wordpress community (of which I am a contributing member) for those affected. It really is nothing more than outright destructiveness and vandalism, the fact that it is being perpetrated digitally making it no less annoying, viscious, mindless, or upsetting for the victim.

Thankfully, Wordpress is very easy to install. My upgrade to 2.8.4 was a simple click on a link at the top of my dashboard, and the wonderful Wordpress has done everything else for me. Perhaps I should thanks the script kiddies out there messing with people's lovingly crafted blogs ... I now have new features to play with :-D"

The Mighty Barry Nugent has given us his thoughts on ""The Dark""
<blockquote>The Dark has echoes of the Matrix about it but rather than having to sit in a chair with a bloody great spike getting rammed into the back of your skull you just need a slick black ‘Darkman style’ overcoat and a smart ass AI construct called Howard Hughes.

Look past the technology on show in the comic and you get a classic origin story involving a guilt ridden scientist trying to right the wrongs of the world while trying to atone for his own personal sins.

The art was solid and combined with snappy dialogue made for some cool fight scenes. I specially liked the loading of different skills sets on the fly to deal with the appropriate situation and be able to fire ‘pure information’ darts at people.

The plot was solid and I loved the idea of ‘liquid information’ and as is the case with so many revolutionary ideas how easily  this technology  can be corrupted.

Overall I thought the Dark  was a great, fast read and I’m looking forward to seeing how the story develops.</blockquote>

For the <a href=""http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23fridayflash"">#fridayflash crowd</a>, and a little limbering up before doing some ""stunt fiction"" at the B<a href=""http://www.thecomicsshow.co.uk"">ritish International Comics Show</a>.

As always, I started off with some random factors from <a href=""http://shortstoryideas.herb.me.uk"">http://shortstoryideas.herb.me.uk</a>. Today's kicker was <em>""A School is the location, anticipation is the theme. A deckchair is an object that plays a part in the story.""</em>

From<em> </em>this we get ... <strong>Football Town.</strong>
<blockquote>He had been at the school as long as anyone could remember. Some people in the town even joked that he'd been out the field, already shouting at some long forgotten quarterback, as they built the school around him. Some people didn't even know his real name. He was simply “Coach”.

But this was a football town, and being called “Coach” was second only to being called “God”.

This year however, had been different. The team had been knocked out of two cups already and had had to resort to friendly games just to fill the schedule and keep the people in the bleachers on a Sunday evening. This was a football town. It's team didn't get knocked out before the quarter finals, and they didn't play friendlies. Ever.

Some people in town were starting to say that maybe, just maybe, Coach was past it.

That was why the team was out on the field for the sixth night in a row, running drill and drill, with Coach sitting in is quirky old deck chair, shouting instructions through a rusty megaphone. The voice of God commanded, but the flesh of his flock was undoubtedly weak.

“Come on you weaklings!” he roared, the megaphone crackling. “Pick your feet up!”

Bryce, the new quarterback, fumbled yet another throw and tripped himself up running to pick up the lost ball. The Coach sighed.

It was true, he had been here a long time, maybe even too long, even by his standards. He had to admit though, he loved football, and he loved to win. He had hoped this year that he might be able to do it without calling in any favours, but another crop of weaklings like these and he would be finished. Thankfully, second to coaching, the other thing that the Coach was good at, was favours.

“Come here, Son,” he said, a rare note of compassion entering his voice as his no-star quarterback limped to the touchline. “You know what kind of life you could have, with a football scholarship? You know how they treat a star quarterback in this town?”

“Yes Sir!” replied the boy.

“Then tell me,” asked the Coach, getting out of his deckchair, “What you give to have that life?”

“Coach,” the boy replied, “You know I'd do anything. Anything ...”

“Good,” said the Coach, “Then I think we can make a deal.”

In this town, being called “Coach” was second to being called “God” ...</blockquote>"

Inspired by Ryan Reed, who asked for a story featuring ""“A man who has been bitten by a radioactive man, a VW Camper Van, and a pie”
<blockquote>Rain rattled against the side of the camper van. Reed tried to ignore it, and concentrated on cooking. Cooking was a lot more complicated for Reed these days than it used to be as, since the bite, he had to work just as hard to keep things out of his meals as put things in.

Thunder crashed overhead and the VW camper rocked from side to side as Reed gingerly lifted the baking tray out of the small oven he had installed into the van. The van, like Reed, had been through a lot of changes, since the bite.

Four years on the run, four years since the bite.

Placing the tray on the edge of the sink, he picked up the piping hot pie and dropped it onto his only plate. He didn't feel the heat of the pie, the flesh of his fingers long dead.

Long dead since the bite.

The rain was gradually turning into hail, hammering harder on the sides of the van. Reed knew that he didn't have long, that soon the rain and the hail wouldn't be the only things hammering on the sides of his van.

The village was less than an hour away and he was sure that the children would have been missed by now. He wished that it didn't have to be children, but they were the only things that worked.

The only things that worked since the bite.

Edging down the van, the wind threatening to topple him at any moment, Reed caught a glimpse of himself, reflected in the windscreen. His flesh was rotten, sloughing off every bone. The poisoning was getting worse. The poisoning that had been eating away at him ever since the bite.

He sat down, and let the aroma of the pie fill his nose.

Soon, he would look like everyone else. Soon, he would be able to walk among the normal people, and no one would know.

The secret was in the pie.

And all it would take was a bite.</blockquote>"

This one was for Richard Griffiths, of Crafty Butchers fame, who just wanted ""spidermonkeys"".

We live to serve ...
<blockquote>Cliff reloaded his rifle as quickly as he could, letting the spent cartridges join those already scattered about his feet. The barrel of the gun was hot enough to scorch the wooden parapet of the outpost as he propped it there, glad for a moment not to have the weight against his shoulder.

“How many of them are there?” asked Delilah.

“Depends,” replied Cliff. “If they breed like monkeys, we've got to be getting to the end of the troupe by now. If they breed like spiders ...”

The words hung in the air as thick as the tropical heat.

“If they breed like spiders …?” Delilah asked meekly.

“Then I don't have enough bullets.”

There was a crash out in the jungle, and the familiar screeching of the spider monkeys. Cliff had tried to work out where the nest was, considering in his darker moments that maybe the only way to survive this was to take the fight to them, to find their home and burn it out, but every part of the jungle seemed to be their territory. This was their place.

“Cliff, maybe we should take the other jeep, try and --”

“They know where the road is,” said Cliff flatly. “You didn't see what happened to Clint, Helen, and the others …  Trust me Delilah, you don't want to end up like that.”

Cliff closed his eyes for a moment. Hunting was a dangerous profession, he'd seen people hurt and killed before. He'd seen the things that an animal can do to a human in a matter of moments, he'd seen how inhuman the things that were left behind looked. What he had seen on the road out of the jungle though, what he had seen in the spider monkey's web… that was something different entirely. That was a human level of cruelty.

The crashing in the jungle grew closer, and the screeching grew louder. Cliff cocked the rifle back up to his shoulder and peered down the sight.

“I can help,” said Delilah, awkwardly hefting up a pistol.

Cliff sighed. They were dead, of that he was certain. Delilah may as well die on her feet.

“Remember to aim low,” he said, with an uncommon note of kindness. “If you hit the poison sack, that seems to do the trick.”</blockquote>"

	<li>Seeing a giant Optimus Prime figure</li>
	<li>Selling off the remaining stock of MWM #1, MWM #2, and MWM Live!</li>
	<li>Finding out how many people actually liked MWM Live but getting away with not having to do it again</li>
	<li>Spilling scalding hot tea down myself whilst pitching</li>
	<li>Meeting Neal and the ironically named ""Little Fat Mikey""</li>
	<li>The water colour of The Dark from Valia</li>
	<li>Terrifying Mr. Cola with my second rendition of ""Tranny Wingman""</li>
	<li>Sharing table space with the hardcore crew of Orang Utan Comics and David Wynne.</li>

	<li>Marveling at the talents of my partner in crime Stu.Art as he sketched up a storm</li>
	<li>Freaking out David Wynne with a ""I wanna sex you up"" duet with Ian Sharman</li>

I sang at least three others songs for starters and I still haven't listed the fun times with the Mighty McAuliffes, the numerous (by which I mean 2) Staceys, Monts tales of Merlin, Belgian Dave, Ryan and Orko (virtually cannon fodder to my J-Bombs, bless their young hearts), wonderfully erudite exchanges with Scott Grandison, comedy ranting like a lunatic at Jimmy Bott, ... and even as I try to draw this paragraph to a close I am sure I am missing someone or something <em>vital</em>. Probably more than one.

To put it as simply as I can 48+ hours of unadulterated comics is good, 48 hours of comics with this company is simple unbeatable. Except perhaps by 72 hours."

Written Sy Wyatt at the now infamous MWM Live! in Bristol, May 2009.
<blockquote>Pressure. Emmett had dealt with pressure his whole life. Pressure to deliver. Pressure to perform. Today, however, he was concerned entirely with the pressure on the outside of his deep sea exploration suit. The soft pinging in his ear told him he was safe, and still attached to the survey ship, thousands of feet above, by the umbilical.

“Can you see it, Emmett?”

“I'm pretty much on top of it. Another hundred or so feet and I'll have contact.”

Emmett imagined the whoops and back-slapping going on on the ship. After months of searching, they had found her.

Emmett's heavy boots hit the shell of the wreck. There was no give, ships like the Inca Queen were built to last, built to keep their cargo safe. Emmett couldn't speculate what kind of ordnance could have sunk her.

“Can you see it? Emmett, can you see it?”

Emmett turned slowly, the high powered lights on the shoulders of his suit skimming along skin of the hulk. They reached a ragged gash, a hole punched in the side of the majestic Inca Queen. Inside, gleaming under the powerful spot lights, was her cargo. Untouched, perfect, preserved by intense pressure and cold of the Inca Queen's deep grave.

Row after row of containers, their contents still a perfect, creamy white and, along the sides, a tell-tale flash of gold.

Emmett smiled. It would be biggest haul of his career.

“I have it. There's at least eight thousand pints of gold top down here.”

Emmett flicked off the radio link before he was deafened by the cheers. Since the bovine flu epidemic, milk had become the most expensive commodity on the planet. The contents of The Inca Queen, once the star “milk float” of the global “Creamy Corporation”, was worth enough to make Emmett and his crew richer than God.</blockquote>"

<blockquote>“OK”, said the landlord, “Here's your uniform.” Carl looked sceptically at the bear skin hat and rusty old gas mask. The job hefting barrels at the Queen's Head was supposed to be easy money, beer funds for his summer vacation. Gas masks and furry hats were not part of the plan.

“This.. is my uniform?”

“You'll understand once you're down there,” said the landlord, and opened up the trapdoor to the cellar. “Best get down there and get the lay of the land, son”

Tucking the hat and the gas mask under his arm, Carl climbed slowly down into the cellar. It was freezing cold, his breath clouding into vapour as his feet touched the stone floor. He felt the crunch of ice, and shivered.

“Put on the hat before you freeze to death,” shouted the landlord from the top of the ladder.

Carl did as he was told, and pressed on into the gloom of the cellar. With every step he took it got colder, and the air thickened with a smell that swiftly escalated into a stench that was almost unbearable. Carl strapped on the gas mask, grateful for the clean air.

He heard the trapdoor close behind him, extinguishing the light from above. In the distance, far further away than he thought the cellar should reach, he could see another tiny light.

A tiny light that was getting closer.

“Don't run,” came a voice from the dark. “You'll fall on the ice and break your neck.”

Out of the darkness, came the barrel-man. The legend of the Queen's Head, the brewer of the infamous home brew. No more than three feet tall, wizened, and dressed in strips of leather and rags, the light that came closer came from a small lantern attached to his belt.

“Here,” he said, thrusting a rotting, dismembered human forearm at Carl. In the arm's rotting hand was a key.

“Keep walking for about another hour, you'll come to a door. Open it with this key, and bring out the barrels. The home brew should be ready.”

Carl felt the cold, dead flesh of the arm in his own hands.

“Why do I need the arm? Can't I just take the key?” he asked.

“You see when you get there,” replied the barrel man. “New boy”</blockquote>"

My favourite piece of open source CMS software has added another significant scalp, with <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov"">http://www.whitehouse.gov</a> making the switch to Drupal.

The move has been orchestrated by Dries himself, through Aquia, along with some third party contractors based in the US. (More details and specifics are available via<a href=""http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/whitehousegov-goes-drupal""> techPresident</a>).

Much is being made of the Obama administration, or at least some aspect of it, making the ""open source choice"". With a foot in each camp (both the closed and open source worlds), I have to wonder if the move is significant and, in a way, I hope it isn't.

Much is being made of the choice as if it represents some fundamental decision by the US Government to chose open source for reasons <em>other</em> than it being the <strong>best technical solution</strong>. <a href=""http://buytaert.net/whitehouse-gov-using-drupal"">Dries has a great take on why this is the case</a>, and I wish more of the news articles out there were picking up on these points.

As an advocate of Drupal, and of open source in general, it being chosen because it is the best solution is the <em>only </em>option that I can support ... because it is the only option that takes open source forward.

Chose open source because it has a better cost/benefit balance, chose it because it is lower risk, more secure, or chose it because it fits your needs. But don't chose it <em>because</em> it is open source, because that's the same as choosing it because it is <em>Microsoft</em> or <em>Google</em> or <em>Sony</em> or any other brand name.

If we can make the playing field cost, risks, time, and function and eliminate the FUD peddled by others, then products and platforms like Drupal <em>will</em> be the best fit, will be selected, and the presence and market share of open source will improve.

But please, let's not turn a victory dance into an awkward ""Dad at a wedding"" moment on the grave of some unknown closed source system. It is unbecoming of us all."

Regular readers will know that I have been working on this project with Rick Lundeen for Markosia since May of 2009 and, having finished the script just a few weeks it ago, I am  incredibly excited to see the cover sitting alongside other previews for Markosia's 2010 line.

Finishing the last chapter of the story was probably one of the toughest things I have had to do as a writer, mostly because I don't think I wanted to let any of the characters go. I hope that's a good thing. Maybe they didn't want to go either. They're tough bastards.

The Dark will be being solicited through Diamond to all good comic shops (more news on that when I have it) and will also be available through book stores, Amazon, etc. More information on that as I have it ..."

Of course, as this is one of <em>my</em> stories, and Insomnia seem to be foolishly giving me free reign <em>again ... </em>they may not be so please to be included as will be to see them there.

Hypergraphia, you see, needs <em>victims</em>. Lots of victims. As Valia does a fine line in likenesses and cameos, we thought it would be funny to kill of Rich. So did other people. Then ... those same people wanted us to kill them as well.

They don't know how we'll do it. They don't know how the story ends. But they want <em>in</em>. Personally, I think that is just plain weird. Nice weird, in a ""that would be cool, Chris"" way, but still weird. Weird is the common demoninator in this fraction of oddness.

So ...

Now there is a <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=190668378067"">Facebook group for people who want Valia and I to kill them</a>, and its <em>growing</em>.

I'm writing this blog post now not to promote it, the damned thing seems to have a life of its own, but just to go on record that whatever happens next ... the story was already written. Honestly."

The series once again teams Millar with fan-favourite artist Steve McNiven and basically asks the question, the quote Millar himself, ""What if Batman were a c*nt?""

Whilst the premise may not seem <em>that</em> original when compared to DC's existing ""Negative Batman"", Owlman of Earth 2, the few snippets available on the web do promise some definite bar-raising in terms of the level of death and destruction one man with a mask and a fancy belt is going to cause. A lot of people blast Millar for being too commercial, for writing comics deliberately for the screen, and for his general self-agrandising and publicity whoring but I am rarely one of them.

Mostly because I would be just as bad, given half a chance ;-)

Digital publishing is fast becoming the norm for comic book publishers, particularly for independents, the ""small press"", and individual creators such as myself.

However, taking your comic onto the 'net, mobile phones, eBook readers, etc. presents a whole new world of options and challenges for publishers and an almost bewildering list of platforms and partners to deal with. My own work has so far spread across <a href=""http://ax.search.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/search?entity=software&amp;media=all&amp;page=1&amp;restrict=false&amp;startIndex=0&amp;term=markosia"">iTunes</a>, <a href=""http://www.myebook.com/chrislynch/"">myebook.com</a>, mobiles via the <a href=""http://www.clickwheel.net/features/165"">ClickWheel</a> platform, and is available as a <a href=""http://www.indyplanet.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=382"">digital comic from IndyPlanet</a> and yet I feel I have barely scratched the surface of this fascinating new marketplace.

Thankfully, some creators and publishers are blazing a trail for others to follow. Notable amongst these is Alex De Campi, who has kindly laid out her breadcrumb trail for us in this article on Bleeding Cool - <a href=""http://www.bleedingcool.com/2009/11/09/uncanny-valleygirl-by-alex-de-campi-5-be-my-guinea-pigs/"">Uncanny Valleygirl by Alex De Campi #5: Be My Guinea Pigs!</a>

I read in the news today that someone has stolen the famous, or infamous, sign from the gates of Auschwitz that reads ""Arbeit macht frei"". ""Arbeit macht frei""  roughly translates to ""work brings freedom"" and was the title of a story that I wrote some time ago for a collection of short stories that was never published.

It is a story very much about guilt and today I am dedicating it to the thieves who have profaned a place that should be a marker to us all, a reminder of man's capacity for inhumanity to man, not the target of petty thievery and greed. May they feel guilty forever more.

I humbly and with the greatest respect for all those fallen present ...

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">WORK BRINGS FREEDOM</h2>
Grossmueller straightened his black tie in the cracked mirror above the sink in his bathroom, and hoped that the cut on this chin would stop bleeding before he had to leave for the ceremony. He knew he shouldn't have tried to use the straight razor, his old hands so unsteady now, but there was something about a straight razor shave, perhaps because nobody did them any more. Like Grossmueller, they were a relic of the past that had not yet quite died, but which were aged beyond repair or redemption.

The knock at the door to Grossmueller's flat was as hurried as ever. His grandson was always late, a habit he had learnt from his father. Grossmueller had never understood what his daughter saw in the oaf, but accepted that perhaps, like straight razors, tastes in men were destined to inevitable decline as well.

“Coming,” barked Grossmueller, as the knocking started again. He checked his tie once more, picked the patch of tissue from his chin, inspected the cut, and headed for the door.

“Hey Pops,” said Danny, Grossmueller's grandson. “You've cut yourself.”

“Thank you,” said Grossmueller, instinctively fingering the cut. His fingertip came away with the thin veneer of blood. Even my blood is tired and thin, thought Grossmueller.

“We're running a bit late,” said Danny, helping Grossmueller into this overcoat.

“You're running late you mean,” corrected Grossmueller.

“Yeah, well, we should be OK for time. It's not like they can start without you, is it?”

Grossmueller raised an eyebrow. “You'd be surprised at the things that go on when people aren't there,” he said.
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;"">***</p>

The Berlin traffic was a bad as ever, the whole city pumping traffic fitfully through itself like a giant diseased heart. Danny drummed his hands on the steering wheel of his car and checked his watch every few seconds.

“We'll get there,” he said, reassuring himself for the fourth time that minute.

Grossmueller gazed absent mindedly out of the window.

“There's no rush,” he said quietly. “They can't start with me, isn't that what you said?”

“Hey, yeah, you're right,” said Danny. “You are the man of the hour after all.”

“Quite,” said Grossmueller.

Danny frowned. “You don't sound like a man whose about to be given a medal,” he said. “The humanitarian award is a big thing you know.”

“I didn't do what I did for a medal,” Grossmueller said bitterly. “I just did it.”

“Well, I think you should have gotten a medal for it years ago. It's an insult, after the lives that you saved, that you're left living up there in that stinking old flat all alone, with nothing to show for what you did.”

“My flat does not stink,” said Grossmueller indignantly, “And I'm quite happy being alone. Would you prefer that I moved in with you and your mother?”

Danny shrugged in the non-committal way that Grossmueller had noticed that young people did, as if they could literally throw the weight of their troubles and worries off them like a damp coat.

“Whatever, I just think you should have been rewarded.”

“You wouldn't,” sighed Grossmueller, “Not if you the truth, the way that it all really happened.”

“You've told us,” said Danny, his brow furrowed, “You told that story like, a thousand times when I was a kid.”

Grossmueller finally tore his eyes from the road and stared at Danny in a way that Danny had never seen his grandfather stare at anyone before. Behind Grossmueller, on the narrow pavement that ran along the side of the road, Danny could see a young mother with a clutch of children. The mother was fussing and fretting over the children, but they didn't seem to be paying her any attention at all. Instead, they were all staring straight at Danny's car, pointing with outstretched hands.

“I lied,” said Grossmueller softly, “I lied about the whole thing.”
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;"">***</p>

Danny turned the engine off, and squirmed around in his seat to face his grandfather, but the man was already gone and in his place sat a stranger. The face was his grandfather's, and his clothes, and even the ramrod straight way that he sat up in his seat belonged to the man that Danny had known all of his life, but the eyes were those of someone very different.

Danny didn't know it, but that was what eyes that had <em>seen things</em><span style=""font-style: normal;""> looked like.</span>

“The traffic might start to move again,” said Grossmueller.

“I don't care,” said Danny flatly. “Tell me what you meant by that.”

“I mean I lied, what more is there to say than that?”

“What more? There's a lot more!” spat Danny, his temper flaring. “You're telling me that all those people you said you'd saved, all those people who you said you got out of ...”

Grossmueller looked down at his feet. His polished shoes reflected his gaunt face back at him.

“You can say it,” he said.

“The death-camp,” said Danny quietly, as if the mere mention of the word would bring down some unspeakable fate upon him. “All those people you said that you got out of there ...”

“I did get them out,” said Grossmueller, “I just lied when I said that I did it alone.”

Danny let out a sigh of relief. “Well, I had always wondered about <em>that</em><span style=""font-style: normal;"">,” he said. “I mean, you were just one guard. I kind of guessed that had a little help from the others.”</span>

“Ah well, that's the other thing,” said Grossmueller. “I wasn't a guard.”

The car in front of Danny's suddenly lurched forward, the traffic serpent awakening briefly and shifting its bulk forward along its course. Danny started the car  and crunched it clumsily into gear.

“What were you?” he asked. His voice was low, and Grossmueller wondering if Danny was hoping that the engine would drown it out.

“I was the camp commandant.”

Danny stalled the car before they had moved an inch.
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; text-align: center;"">***</p>

Danny pulled the car into the first side-street they reached, a cramped single lane lined with houses that had would once, a long time ago, have been considered quite grand.

“Faded grandeur eh?” said Grossmueller, looking at the house

Danny slipped the car into a space and cut the engine. His face was fixed, as if he lacked the emotions to deal with the information that he had received, and now his mind was racing to keep up.

“Tell me,” he said finally. “Just tell me everything.”

“Aren't we going to be late?” asked Grossmueller.

“We'll make it,” replied Danny. “Just tell me what really happened Pops, please.”

“Alright,” said Grossmueller. “I'll you you secret, my sorrow.”

And, just like that, the secret that had shadowed him for sixty years fell from his lips.
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; text-align: center;"">***</p>

<em>I was never a religious man, but I wasn't an aethiest either. Agnostics you call them nowadays, as if indecision is some kind of choice. I suppose I always believed in something, even if I didn't know what it was. I just had this inkling that it was ... there.</em>

<em>Maybe I was looking for something, something to believe in, something to pin my colours to. A lot of people were back then, you know? There was unrest, real unrest, you could feel it in the air. Every bar, every home, every street, every town. It was everywhere, as if someone had joined up all those little powder keg people and places and then lost the match. It was ready to explode, but no one knew where or how or when.</em>

<em>When He came, well ... some people just said it was fate. Some still do.</em>

<em>It wasn't hard to get involved. For someone like me, it would have been hard not to. I was young, I'd been in a little trouble, I was out of work and running low on luck and hope. He offered me something, something that I thought was real. I know it's hard for you to understand now, but it was a different time back then. Giving us someone to blame ... it was so easy.</em>

<em>By the time any of us began to think that it was going wrong, it was too late. </em>

<em>Far too late. </em>

<em>It was like I was on a train, and my ticket said I should have gotten off three stops ago, and now I didn't know where the train was going and I didn't know who I could tell about my ticket, or what they would do if they found out. That was the way that it was, for a lot of us. You just kept your head down, and tried to make it look like you should be there.</em>

<em>Because if you weren't with them ... well, you know what happened to people who weren't with them.</em>

<em>So, next thing I know I'm in the party, then I'm in the army, and then they're moving me to this place in Poland. It's a guard job, they tell me. It's cold and it's hard, but it's important work and they need people they can trust. People like me. </em>

<em>Let me tell you something son; if someone says they need “people like you, who they can trust”, it means that they don't trust you at all. I knew were I was going, everyone knew something about that place, and I honestly thought that I might end up on the wrong side of the fence after all.</em>

<em>They took us up there by train, the same train they used to move ... the others. I remember sitting there, hearing the tracks thunder underneath us, counting the miles. Every click, every clack, every rattle; they all took us closer to the place. Nobody spoke in the truck on the way, I remember that too. Soldiers aren't quiet by nature you see, especially not when you put them all together. But nobody in that truck said a word the entire way there. </em>

<em>I guess, like me, they were all sizing the others up. I could see the others like me, party men who had gotten not far but far enough, and I could see the young recruits who seemed to have no idea where they were going at all. And I saw the ones that kept checking their watches, and dusting down their uniforms. The ones that hopped from foot to foot like they were waiting for a first date with the girl of their dreams. I realised, sometime during the clicks and the clacks and the rattles, that they were the only ones who had <strong>asked</strong> to be there.</em>

<em>It was one of them who eventually broke the silence, just as the train stopped for the first and final time.</em>

<em>He said “End of the line.”</em>

<em> </em>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;"">***</p>

“<span style=""font-style: normal;"">You've told me all of this,” said Danny, drumming his fingers on the steering wheel.</span>

“But it's important Danny,” said Grossmueller, “It's important you know that I didn't <em>want</em> to go, that everything I told you about how I ended up in the party, and how I ended up as a solider, they were all true.”

Danny's hands clamped down on the steering wheel suddenly, his temper flaring up once again. “No! No it's not important!” he snapped. “What's important is that you tell how you really got those people out of there, and you tell me why you did it, and you tell me how in <em>hell</em> you were the camp commandant when it all happened!”

Grossmueller rubbed his chin with the palm of his hand. His heart was pounding in his chest, beating harder and faster than it had in many, many years. There was blood on Grossmueller's hand when he took it away from his chin, and he couldn't help but smile at the subtle symbolism of it all.

He held his hand up to Danny, showing him the thin streak of scarlet on his crinkled palm.

“Mysterious ways,” he whispered.
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; text-align: center;"">***</p>

<em>You asked me how in <strong>hell</strong></em><span style=""font-style: normal;""><strong> </strong><em>I became the commandant? Well, I suppose that hell must have had something to do with it, because God and heaven certainly didn't. As I said, I'd always had a belief in something, even if I didn't know what it was. That was true until I arrived in that place. </em></span>

<em>I didn't believe it was the end of the line. </em>

<em>I believed it was the end of the world.</em>

<em>Trust me son, when I tell you that no God, no being who could see us all and see what we were doing could have suffered that place to exist. It was hell, son, I can't say it any more plainly than that. It was hell, and I was keeping people in just long enough for them to work themselves to death... or worse.</em>

<em>I can't remember much about those first weeks. I think that might the only blessing given to me in this life, and I can't say that I deserve more. All I remember is the routine, the orders, the cold, and the smell. You hear people talking about the stench of death, the smell in that place could have convinced you that death had taken up permanent residence in the place. </em>

<em>After a while, it was more than a smell, more than a stench. It became the atmosphere of the place, as if we had quite literally created our own world beneath this thick fog of decay and death and fear. The fear, that was the worst smell of all, because you knew that it was ours just as much as it was theirs, and I can't tell you the guilt that I felt for that. For me to be afraid ... it was disgusting, and greedy, and weak. But it was being all of those things that had brought me there, and in a way once you recognised those things in yourself, the smell began to smell a little like home. </em>

<em>I don't know what would have happened to me if I'd been allowed to sink down into that smell, into that place.</em>

<em>It happened on a Sunday morning. I see the relevance of <strong>that</strong> now, of course. There had been snow the night before, and the whole place was white for just a few hours. Even the snow couldn't clean the place though – it was like draping a wedding dress over a corpse. You knew it was under there, its grotesque shape only muted by the crisp white blanket, and the blood already soaking through by the time I took my post.</em>

<em>The commandant was determined to keep the place running, despite the weather. He ran the whole place based on the contents of a little pocket book, like a miser keeping his accounts close to his chest. Those people, all those people, they were just scratches in his book in the end. That was their legacy, a line of lead on a page. They say that, when he filled the book one day, he just rubbed out what he had already written and started again.</em>

<em>I was up in the guard tower, the bitter wind cutting right to my bones. I remember watching them trudging across to the shower block, their footprints in the snow looked so tiny from where I stood. There were children with them, and the snow filled their footprints almost as soon as they made them.</em>

<em>I watched them all go in. They all knew what it meant, why they were being taken there. Some of the others didn't watch, or couldn't watch, or wouldn't watch, but I always did. It wasn't voyeurism, or ghoulishness though Danny. It was respect.</em>

<em>Everything seemed to be happening as it always had, the mechanism of our great factory moving as precisely as it ever had, a clockwork engine of death in which all the cogs and gears and springs were us. I had turned away, my eyes staring out into the whiteness that remained outside the camp, when I heard the scream.</em>

<em>It was the commandant.</em>

<em>There was panic, and shouting, and running, as if the whole place had suddenly woken up to what it was. I clambered down from the guard tower and ran towards the shower block. We called it that, even amongst ourselves, as if we were the ones who had to be convinced. Maybe we were.</em>

<em>When I reached the door, I saw what had made the commandant scream.</em>

<em>There was a window, so that you could see into the chamber. The commandant used to stand there, and watch them while it ... happened. I'd heard a rumour that he kept odds in that little book of his, and you could take a bet with him if you had the stomach for it. I'd never asked if it was true or not, but I'd bet he wouldn't have given odds on anyone seeing what we all saw that day.</em>

<em>In the centre of the chamber, thigh deep in the dying and dead, was a boy. He didn't move, not even to blink or to breath. He simply stood, and stared, and pointed at the commandant as if his finger, his very finger, might pierce the man's soul. Those eyes Danny, I tell you those eyes ... there was something so deeply inhuman about them, even in that place they seemed so wrong. We knew, somehow all of us knew, that he was looking at us, and sending us a message.</em>

<em>He was telling us “I'm watching you.”</em>

<em> </em>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;"">***</p>

“<span style=""font-style: normal;"">My God,” said Danny. “My God ... what happened?”</span>

Grossmueller ran his hand through his wiry white hair. “The commandant sent in two guards, after the gas had been purged, to shoot the boy and take him to the camp doctor to be ...”

“You can say it,” said Danny.<em> </em>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; text-align: center;"">***</p>

<em>Dissection wasn't an uncommon end for some of the victims of the camp. Science was one of the many excuses we used to help us sleep just a little at night.</em>

<em>The following day, no one was sent to the shower block. For the first day since I had been there, the incinerator fell quiet, and the air cleared just a little. For a while, the only fear I could smell was my own.</em>

<em>The story had gotten around the camp like wildfire, despite the best efforts of the officers to bury it. A place like that thrives on stories. The more unreal the place becomes, you see, the less real the things that you see, and the things that you do, are. Some days, it was the slim hope that the whole thing was just somehow going to end, to stop, to cease to <strong>be </strong>in any way ... that's what kept me going. There couldn't be <strong>two</strong> worlds, could there? And this couldn't have been Earth, our Earth, the place where we were born. It just ... couldn't.</em>

<em>By the next day though, everything was back to normal. The commandant ordered double shifts on the gas chamber and the incinerator. Extra prisoners were drafted to join those who already worked carrying the bodies from the chamber to the incinerator or emptying the ash from the ass of the great beast.</em>

<em>The camp doctor had come up with some explanation, we all assumed, for how the child had survived the gas chamber.</em>

<em>I was back in the guard tower, once more watching the procession of victims, the march from life to death played before my very eyes. This time, I watched them all the way in, and kept my eyes on the shower block even after the last of them had entered. There was something in the air, something charged, like the moment before lightening strikes.</em>

<em>When the scream came from the chamber, I was already clambering down the stairs.</em>

<em>I pushed my way to the front of the crowd around the commandant. He had his face pressed against the glass, his pudgy cheeks leaving greasy patches on the window as he huffed and puffed. </em>

<em>On the other side of the glass stood the boy, just as he had before.</em>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;"">***</p>

“<span style=""font-style: normal;"">The same boy?” asked Danny. “How? That doesn't make any sense.”</span>

“Sense didn't come into it,” said Grossmueller. “Haven't you been listening to what I've been saying? That place didn't <em>work</em> like anywhere else on Earth, I'm sure of that now. It was as if we'd put a barbed wire fence and gates around a patch of Hell and pulled it up to us from beneath the world. Don't you think that's what Hell is Danny? The absence of logic, sense, reason ... a place where things happen just because they <em>can</em>?”

“I don't know,” said Danny, his voice tired. “You tell me you've been lying to me, to everyone, all this time about the way in which you saved all those people, but this story ...”
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; text-align: center;"">***</p>

“<em>I don't believe it, I don't believe it,” that was all the commandant could say, over and over again. He was as rigid as a board, a talking manikin stuck to the glass of the gas chamber. </em>

<em>I don't know how long he stood there for, but eventually someone took him by the arm and led him back to his quarters. They say that they had to tip him back onto his bed, his arms and legs locked into place as if he were still at that window.</em>

<em>The rest of us just stood there and watched. Someone went for the doctor, but he was nowhere to be found. They pumped more and more gas into there, until the air was thick with it, and still the child would not fall. He just stood there, naked and silent and pointing at us all with that wicked finger of his, as if damnation itself was at its tip.</em>

<em>Finally, they vented the gas, and someone said “What are we going to do?”</em>

<em>And with that, I opened the door to the chamber, walked inside, put my gun to the child's head, and fired.</em>

<em>It took four shots to bring him to his knees, and another two to finish the job.</em>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;""><em>***
</em>

“<span style=""font-style: normal;"">Jesus,” said Danny. His cheeks suddenly drained of colour and, swinging his car door open, he vomited copiously onto the pavement. “I can't ... you ...”</span>

“I can't defend it,” said Grossmueller, “But you have to understand, it wasn't a human being that I did that to.”

“And was the way that you thought about all of them was it?” spat Danny, bile coating his lips,

“As something subhuman? That was a kid Pops! A kid!”

“No wait, you don't understand!” said Grossmueller desperately. “Please, let me finish.”

Grossmueller almost couldn't bear the look of pain, and loss, and disgust in his grandson's eyes as he watched the boy make his decision.

“Then finish,” said Danny finally, “We've got a ceremony to get to.”

“We'll make it,” said Grossmueller.
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; text-align: center;"">***</p>

<em>When I came out the chamber, the others had already gone. Every officer, every guard, even the technicians who operated the chamber. I was alone with the dead.</em>

<em>I summoned the prisoners whose job it was to take the bodies to the incinerator, and left them to their work. It had started to snow again, and until dark I simply walked the boundaries of the camp, as if the answers to all the questions that now haunted me might be found laying there on the hard ground. No matter which way I walked, my shadow seemed to be in front of me, twisting and writhing with my every step.</em>

<em>I don't remember returned to the barracks, or even falling asleep, but I remember being awoken by one of the other soldiers. Like so many of the men I worked alongside, I had never bothered to ask his name and he had not asked mine. There was comfort in anonymity, I assumed, for all of us.</em>

<em>He told me the commandant had been found dead, and that none of the other officers could be found. Without thinking, I asked him to take me to the body.</em>

<em>We walked out across the camp, towards the shower block. I had begun to become used to moving and to speaking and to acting without thinking, as if I were a tram running along its groove in the road. My path, as wicked, damned, and condemned as it might be, was mapped out before me. Whether it had begun or ended with killing the boy I could not say. Perhaps there was no point in my route any more where I would be allowed to ask such questions.</em>

<em>The solider who had woken me left me at the door to the shower block, and said he would go no further. I entered, and found myself once more alone with the dead. </em>

<em>The commandant stood naked in the centre of the gas chamber, as rigid as when I had last seen him, but this time frozen with his hand outstretched, pointing at the glass. His face was contorted in a callous, evil grin, the same one I had seen him give the few prisoners who inadvertently caught his eye on their way to the chamber. I remember one of the guards, one of the few who did not revile the commandant, saying that it was the smile that the commandant would give to God or the Devil, which ever claimed him first.And of them had claimed him, for certain. He was as dead as anything else that stayed in that room long enough.</em>

<em>I left him where he stood. My path leading inexorably elsewhere.</em>

<em>Outside the shower block, the few remaining guards were waiting for me. I recognised them all, they were the men who had travelled with me here in the train a lifetime or more ago. I wondered if my face had aged in the same way that theirs had. I had long since ceased to look at myself in the mirror.</em>

“<em>We're the only ones left,” one of them said.</em>

“<em>What are we going to do?”</em>

“<em>Our jobs,” said another, one of the ones I remembered as being anxious to get here, one of the few I suspected had sought out this conscription into hell. “They've done this, the prisoners. We should gas 'em all.</em>

“<em>There's not enough of us,” said another. “We need to keep them under control until more guards and officers can get here.”</em>

<em>They continued to argue amongst themselves, so easily falling into the normal human patterns of petty bickering and fighting for a position on the pecking order that they might have truly, if only for a moment, forgotten where we were.</em>

<em>As they were all facing me, I was the first one to see the prisoners coming.</em>

<em>They moved slowly, silently, a shuffling army. At their head, leading them step by step through the camp, was the boy. </em>

<em>He didn't look like the boy any more of course. He was just a ... shape, a shade, a patch of blackness. Sometimes it was the shape of the boy, other times the shape of the something else, something tall and dark and powerful.</em>

<em>The thing flowed like ink towards us, as if the whole world were a canvas on which it had drawn itself. I felt sick, dizzy, the more I looked at it, as if were being flattened down by its presence. Do you remember, when you were just a little one, I took you to see that film where we wore the three-dee glasses? I think that is what we looked like to him; two sides that only had depth if you looked at them from the right angle.</em>

<em>I looked away, and the shade became the boy again in my peripheral vision.</em>

<em>I opened my mouth to speak, but no words would come out.</em>

<em>And so, I simply pointed.</em>

<em>And one by one, the others turned and saw what I did.</em>

“<em>I'll tell you what to do,” I said. “Find tools; hammers, saws, and nails.”</em>

“<em>We have guns,” said the eager guard, shielding his eyes against the terrible presence of the thing. “Why do we need tools?”</em>

“<em>Because we are going to make sledges,” I replied. “For them.”</em>

<em>There was moment, just a moment, between us all, and then they spoke as one.</em>

“<em>Yes Commandant.”</em>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: center;"">***</p>

“<span style=""font-style: normal;"">Wait,” said Danny. “You're telling me what exactly? That the boy you killed wasn't a boy, that he was something else, and that he made you release all of those prisoners?” </span>

There was disbelief in the boy's voice, and Grossmueller could hardly blame him. In sixty years, this was the first time that he had told his story to anyone.

“He didn't make me do it, no,” said Grossmueller, “It's more complicated than that.”

“And you believe this?” asked Danny. “You think this really happened?”

“Of course, why would I make it up?”

Danny smiled. “You're getting old Pops, and maybe you're getting confused. You did an amazing thing, and you did it in the worst place and the worst time. The stress you must have been under ... its no wonder that you would want to forget about it. This story of yours ...”

“It's not a story!” shouted Grossmueller. “It's my life!”

“But how can you be <em>sure</em>?” asked Danny.

“Because I still see him,” said Grossmueller, as it was the most obvious thing in the world. “I see him every night.”
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; text-align: center;"">***</p>

<em>I took us just two days and nights to make enough sledges to carry the prisoners into the mountains. No one slept, and no one spoke save to ask for a tool, or to offer someone help. We all worked together, as if there had never been a wall or a fence or a war between us. </em>

<em>The thing watched us every moment, hovering somehow at every shoulder. Our world was small, I suppose, compared to where it came from. </em>

<em>The camp had ample provisions, even spread amongst so many, and on the morning of the third day, the prisoners headed out from the camp, passing under the gates that had once promised no return.</em>

<em>We watched them go; me and the guards and the thing. When they had finally vanished into the endless white, the thing moved between us, stopping at each to bend its huge head and whisper to us. Only one replied, the man who had been so eager to come to this place, the man who had believed in what we doing. </em>

<em>The thing sliced him in two with a flash of gold.</em>

<em>The rest of us went our separate ways, taking what food and equipment we could carry. It would be three days before any soldiers would arrive at the camp.</em>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; text-align: center;"">***</p>

“And that's the true story about how you freed all of those prisoners?” said Danny. Grossmueller didn't think it was really a question.

“Yes, son, that's the truth.”

Danny rested his head for a moment on the steering wheel of the car.

“What did it tell you?” he asked, “The thing?”

“It's name,” answered Grossmueller, “And a few other things.”

“Such as?”

“How to keep a secret.”

“I'm not sure I believe you Pops, I'm sorry,” said Danny. “Maybe I just don't want to.”

“It's alright,” said Grossmueller, “I didn't tell you because I wanted you to know or because I thought you would understand. I just don't deserve to be remembered as a hero, at least not by anyone that it might mean something to. <em>This</em> is how my story ends.”

Danny looked at his watch. “I think we've missed the ceremony,” he said.

“It doesn't matter. I didn't want to go anyway.”

Grossmueller rubbed his chin again. This time, there was no blood.

“I think I'll go home and finish off my shave,” he said, “If you don't mind taking me.”

“Sure,” said Danny, turning over the engine and pulling the car back out onto the narrow side street. “But I do wish you'd use that electric razor I bought you for Christmas. You haven't exactly got a steady hand, and there's a reason they call them cut-throat razors you know.”

Grossmueller smiled and gave a shrug that he hoped matched one of Danny's.

“There are some things you can only do with a good straight razor Danny, trust me on that.”</blockquote>"

Started work on a special Christmas story this evening, and thought I would share a few opening paragraphs with you ...

I had only planned one short story this Christmas, but I have notes for at least three. Hopefully I will have enough time to write them all before Christmas is well and truly upon us.

This first story features the long overdue return of ""Liason to the Strange"" Dr. Hershell Grey, last seen in the story ""The God Trap"" that I wrote for Insomnia's ""Choices"" anthology.

So, without further ado ... he's the teaser ...
<blockquote>The snow crunched satisfying underneath Dr. Hershell Grey's feet as he trudged across the car park of the small country pub, lost somewhere in the heart of middle England. Around them, the village was silent save for the creaking of the trees as their boughs were bent by the gradual accumulation of snow and the distant sound of traffic. The pub had been closed for hours, and only the fairy lights that were slung across the windows and underneath the gabels were still on, defiantly burning in blues and reds and greens against the backgroup of endless white. The owners were no doubt asleep, blissfully unaware of the visitor in their car park.

The visitor the Dr. Grey had come to see.

Hershell could hear the steady trudge of the soldiers boots behind him. They kept their distance, respectful of his assumed rank if not the gravity of the situation that they found themselves in.

""Stay back,"" he warned them. ""I can see him.""

Slumped against a makeshift diorama of a nativity scene, a film of snow slowly enveloping him, was the unmistakable shape of Santa Claus.

""It's just a guy in a suit,"" grumbled a voice from behind Dr. Grey. It was the unmistakeable Northern English growl of Captain Jennings, Hershell's liason to the British Army and a man of conveniently limited imagination.

""Keep thinking that,"" replied Dr. Grey. ""It's important.""

Jennings did little more than grunt in reply, but acquiesed to Grey's order to stay where he was, as did the men under his command. Grey meanwhile crept closer, his shoes squeeking against the snow underfoot. As he approached, the scarlet and black figure shifted, loosening some of the snow from its back and releasing its grip on a bottle of brown liquid. The bottled skidded towards Grey, carried on the slight incline of the car park.

""Rum,"" muttered Grey, as the bottle passed him. ""Hardly the most festive tipple. You might be right after all, Jennings.""

Without warning something shifted underfoot, a rumble that seemed to come from every point around them. Snow shifted on the room of the pub and dropped down in heavy sheets onto the ground below, scattering the beer garden furniture, as the silence of the village was pierced by the braying and screeching of car alarms. A window shattered as a crack appeared in one wall of the pub, snaking up from the ground in moments.

""Then again,"" Grey thought to himself, cursing his earlier doubts. He had been the UN's ""Chief Liason"" to the strange, unusual, mythic, and unexplained for over twelves years, and he had dealt with his fair share of ""Christmas incidents"" whilst overseeing dozens more at the same time each year. Mostly, that meant just sitting with a bemused and stupified Santa until the sun came up on Christmas morning. But sometimes, it meant the ""Chief Liason"" who was the one who signed off on the bullet that turned something strange and usual and mythic into something cold, and dead, and ready for an incinerator.

Tonight didn't feel like either of those type of nights.

Tonight felt like one of those ""save the whole world"" nights.</blockquote>"

<blockquote>(W) Chris Lynch (A) Rick Lundeen.

Imagine a story that you can drink, a story that you can feel, a story you can live. Welcome to the city of Dante, and the world of Memetech. As a wave of drugs that create living stories sweeps his city, one man fights back as 'The Dark'. A vigilante who wields fiction as a weapon, he is the last hope for a city where nothing is what it seems. A stunning new sci-fi thriller.</blockquote>
Online retailers are already starting to the list The Dark for pre-order. Orders for The Dark will need to be in before the end of January 2010, so please make sure you let your local comic store know about the book and order <em>your</em> copy. As most people know, Diamond reserve the right to drop any book that does not meet their minimum order benchmark, so it is crucial that we get all the orders that we can.

Rick, the team at Markosia, and myself are all working hard on promoting the book, so expect to see a lot of press over the next few days and weeks.

Fantastic news broke on <a href=""http://www.bleedingcool.com/2010/01/27/diamond-will-now-honour-comic-book-orders-even-if-they-fall-below-minimum-levels/"">Bleeding Cool</a> yesterday with an announcement from Diamond that they are changing their policy on the much publicised, and much maligned, ""minimum order threshhold"".

Implemented last year, the order threshold previous basically meant that Diamond had the right to cancel orders for any book that did not reach their minimum order values. Retailers who had ordered the book would not get it, nor would their customers, even if they had pre-ordered, and effectively the book would be dead.

This rule has been a bane for the small press. I commented on this just recently whilst being interviewed for the SidekickCast and Comic Book Outsiders, bemoaning not only my own heartache as a creator as I waited to see if my book was going to make the grade, but also commenting on how <em>thin</em> Previews seemed to have become since this rule had taken effect. I'm not claiming that I ever painstakingly perused the independent press pages, but there absence was apparent.

But, that was yesterday. Under the new rules, if a book is solicited then Diamond will ship whatever orders are placed. No minimums. No cancellations.

The cynic in me wants to comment on how Diamond have made this game changing announcment on the same day that we get the mcuhlauded ""iPad"", which many people are proclaiming as the ""saviour of the comic industry"" by finally providing a portable, comic book sized delivery mechanism for comics. I have resisted the urge to comment on the iPad, but I will simply say this ... we already have a portable, comic book sized medium for comics. It's called comics. <em>Case closed</em>.

Thankfully, the cynic is clearly too busy sniping at the iPad to poke holes in what Diamond are doing, and so it is left to the far more optimistic part of my brain to finish this blog post.

What Diamond are doing here is throwing the doors of the bazaar open again and letting independent publishers, and creators, back in. Create a book, solicit a book, and whatever orders you can drum up will be placed, and your book <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">will</span> ship. You may not make a profit on your print run, but it's not Diamond's job to make sure you do. You may not get great reviews, but it was <em>your</em> job to make a great book. You may not get retailers interested in your book at all. And, yes, if selling your book is not <em>profitable</em> for Diamond (and they <em>are</em> a business, not a public institution), they might not carry another book from you that readily again, but at least you don't have to leave the party now with your trousers around your ankles and your head still wet with water from the toilet flush. If you only sell ten, those ten will ship.

That may not sound like much, but as a creator who has spent a month gnawing his nails down to stumps waiting to find out if Diamond were going to place an order with my publisher or <em>not</em>, with <em>not </em>blowing a hole in the side of our plans that it was going to some astonishing effort to repair, it's the best news I've had this month.

Better than the <em>iPad</em>, anyway."

So, I finally succumbed to temptation and decided to trade in my Nokia XPress Music 5800 for an iPhone. When I bought the 5800 it was as the result of a detailed ""pound for pound"" comparison with the iPhone and, for my needs at the time, the 5800 came out on top. Was the fact that I didn't have to change networks to get this phone dominant in my decision making? Not really, but it was certainly a factor.

Some months later however, I find myself buying an iPod Touch. I have comics coming on the platform, I want to listen to podcasts in my car, etc. and I manage to make a case convincing enough (at least for me) that I <em>need</em> this device. And, all in all, it was a jolly good purchase. So good, in fact, that it made me wonder if had made a mistep with not picking up an iPhone in the first place.

Thankfully, O2's exclusivity on iPhones in the UK came to end recently and you can now get the phone on the network of your choice without the hooplala of unlocking (or ""jailbreaking"", as Apple folk like to have cool names for <em>everything</em>) the device.

Of course, if you signed your 18 month contract with Orange in blood, as I had to to obtain my shiny-at-the-time Nokia 5800, you might have a bit of a wait or a hellishly big bill ahead of you. Effectively, unless your contract is up, the only way that Orange will let you trade up to an iPhone is to start a new contract. Even if, like me, you've got more than a decade of faithful customership behind you. For shame, Orange, you might think. And you are probably right.

Giving the issue some thought, however, I realised that all I really wanted was iPhone apps and iPhone Safari browsing whilst I was out of range of any WiFi signals. There is <em>lots</em> of free WiFi out there, so this is a rare state really. If only I could use my Nokia 5800's internet connectivity with my iPod Touch ... somehow ...

And, thus, McGuyver Time began.

First port of call was to see if I could use the Nokia's internet connection over Bluetooth, as I can with my laptop if push comes to shove somewhere out in the winds. Since the iPod/iPhone OS 3.0 upgrade, the Bluetooth chip in the iPod Touch does <em>work</em>, but it seems curiously reluctant to connect to a mobile phone. <em>I wonder why Apple ;-)</em>

A little bit of Googling later, and it seems the BlueTooth chip has been crippled somewhat so that it will/can only connect to BlueTooth headphones, earpieces, and microphones. Neat for the podcaster ""on the go"" or someone who would prefer to look like a member of the Borg collective than appear to be using an iPod, but no use to me right now. What I need, is connectivity.

My Googling continued however, and that was when I discovered <a href=""http://www.joiku.com/index.php"">Joiku</a> via <a href=""http://www.geardiary.com/2008/07/21/my-ipod-touch-3g/"">a post on Gear Diary</a>.

Joiku provide a piece of software for a range of handsets, including pretty much every recent Nokia model, that allows you to share your 3G internet connection via WiFi. WiFi which the iPod touch has <em>in abudance</em>. One quick download later, and the <strong>free</strong> version of ""Joiku Spot"" has turned my Nokia 5800 into a WiFi hotspot. One quick reconfigure of the iPod later, and it is connected, and I sent my first TweetDeck tweet from my iPod, to my phone and, from my phone, to the sweet sweet world of the Internet.

In theory, this will work for any device with WiFi. For a Nokia 5800 and an iPod Touch, I can confirm it does!

Want to try? These are the steps:
<ol>
	<li>Get your phone out and use the phone's browser to go to <strong><a href=""http://www.joiku.com/index.php"">http://www.joiku.com/index.php</a></strong></li>
	<li>Click on ""Joiku Spot Light""</li>
	<li>Select your model of phone and click the download link</li>
	<li>Sign up, or not, for their newsletter. Up to you and makes no difference.</li>
	<li>Download the installer to your phone and install. On my Nokia, I just opted to ""Open"" the file and the phone did the rest.</li>
	<li>Switch your phone off and on again (at least, I had to)</li>
	<li>Go to your ""Applications"" and find the Joiku Spot app.</li>
	<li>Agree to terms. Blah blah, normal stuff.</li>
	<li>""Start"" the Joiku Spot hotspot</li>
	<li>Grab your iPod Touch and search for the new Joiku ... (there will be a <em>long</em> unique name) ... hotspot</li>
	<li>Connect</li>
	<li>Tweet, Browser, do whatever!</li>
</ol>
Right now I am in the testing phase with this and so it's ""reader of blog post beware"". Remember that your phone tarrif may not come with much inclusive internet usage, and just because you are on ""WiFi"" from your iPod, you will be consuming bandwidth via your phone. Equally, keep in mind that your phone is going to be pulling double duty, both 3G and WiFi connections running at once, so in terms of battery life ""your mileage may vary"".

You should also keep in mind that, in the free version of this software, the hotspot is <strong>open</strong> and can be used by anyone. There is a premium version, for 9 euros, which can be secured. If the next 48 hours pan out, and I get some decent use out of Joiku without trashing my phone battery, they can expect to have a new customer."

Software Development has a habit of throwing up the same problems again and again. Subtle variations abound, but I have always believed that with a few core programming techniques <em>most</em> problems can be solved. In an eighty/twenty world, only twenty percent of problems are interesting and only twenty percent of <em>those</em> require a truly original or innovative solution.

The trick is identifying the underlying problem, or <em>design pattern</em>, that you are dealing with and then applying your tried and tested algorithm. Of course, it helps a great deal if you can remember the precise code for that algorithm.

That's where sites like ""<a href=""http://www.artfulsoftware.com/infotree/mysqlquerytree.php"">Common MySQL Queries</a>"" come in. A fantastic repository of general purpose algorithms for common, and not so common, problems, it is something that any developer working with MySQL should have bookmarked. The majority of the code is portable to other RDBMS platforms, but it is ""cut and paste"" simple for MySQL.

This has been a public service announcement on behalf of people who can't remember how to ""do that thing they did last time""."

<blockquote>Not only has Chris Lynch created an incredibly interesting concept to use as the basis of this story, but he's also created an incredibly unique plot ... Rick Lundeen's linework on this story has a very clean and smooth look to it, which is complimented by some really vibrant colouring ...

The Dark is a highly original and inventive graphic novel, with an intriguing and involving plot that really keeps readers on their toes. It's a book that you're going to want to read at least twice, trust me! Forty-Five was my early pick for graphic novel of the year, but it looks like it's already got some tough competition in the form of The Dark!</blockquote>

As of March 25th The Dark will available for download in four installments to your PSP. All of the installments have the same release date, so you will be able to pick up the equivalent of the entire trade from day one.The Dark is taking  pride of place alongside Markosia's critically acclaimed ""Dark Mists"" as the first Markosia titles to launch on the platform. Markosia were also able to reveal today that The Dark is also one of two Markosia titles that have been signed up exclusively by Sony for the platform!

‘These are exciting times for us,’ says publisher Harry Markos, ‘there is no denying that the digital comic is here to stay and it will have a major say over the next year or two. We are delighted to be partnering with Sony in this venture and from what I have seen so far; this is very much an exciting step forward. The graphics look amazing on PSP, crystal clear and surprisingly user-friendly thanks to the Autoflow feature.’

For those who remember the early days of ""The Dark"" as a project, digital was always a key medium for us, and I'm delighted that Sony have put their weight behind us by signing the project exclusively.

I'll see you all on the Playstation forums!

First off, many thanks to Ace for hosting the signing. If you've never been, it is an absolutely great store. Lovely layout, brilliant stock, and really great staff ... a true gem. It also seems pretty easy to get to, at least if the District Line is running (more on <em>that</em> later, thankfully I was chauffer driven to London like the fabulous celebrity I am).

The signing went very well, with lots of very positive feedback on the book. A lot of people already knew about the book as well, so it's good to know that all the podcasting and reviewer stalking has been worth it and everyone's support for the book is working.

Obviously London is fair distance from my usual stomping grounds and with my FP signing, Cribbs Causeway, and then Bristol not <em>that</em> far around the corner, I was hard pressed to convince many of the faithful that they should make the epic journey to the big smoke. Fortunately, <a href=""http://artyougrewupwith.com/"">Huw J</a> is quite clearly the King of London, knows just about everyone, and was immensely gracious in sending many of his visitors, friends, family, etc. my way to take a look at Te Dark.

Despite it being as difficult to pitch without spoilers as ever, a number of people bought copies and hopefully they enjoy the book and appreciate me not giving away any secrets!

So, one down and many to go. <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=328755030929"">My next signing is in the evening on April 8th at Forbidden Planet in Cardiff</a>. This is the home town gig, and hopefully I'll see you there!"

Sometime later and Tim is still going strong. So strong, in fact, that he's given over a page of the latest issue of Mass Movement magazine to me to complete their regular column/feature ""It Ruined My Life"".

I won't spoil the article, but obvious I talk about comics. And magic. And a certain <em>Grant Morrison</em>.

Five Reasons IPhone Vs. Android Isn't Mac Vs Windows#
Tim O'Reilly tweeted out what he called a ""compelling"" article today, the titular ""Five Reasons iPhone vs. Android isn't Mac vs Windows"" by Mark Sigal. Having read the article I countered by tweeting that I thought the article was ""biased"" and ""unbalanced"". Tim, in turn, was gracious enough to tweet back ""<a href=""http://bit.ly/bIhrDB""><em>@chrislynch_mwm U seemingly don't like it when someone challenges your views. I found the piece compelling because I'd assumed the opposite</em></a>""

Fair enough,  I thought, and admittedly it was maybe a little churlish to unfollow Tim just for passing on the article. I still don't agree with Tim's position though so, in the interests of open debate and to prove I really <em>do</em> enjoy a challenge, I thought I would post up something here to rebuke/challenge what <em>I</em> feel are the unbalanced points the article puts forth. Hopefully Tim will respond in due course.

Mark broke his view down into ""<em>five 'little picture' reasons Apple vs Google isn't destined for the same outcome as Apple vs Microsoft</em>"". My response follows the same format, but challenges Mark's conclusions.
<blockquote><strong>1. Retail Distribution</strong>: During the PC Wars, everything came down to distribution and presence on limited retail shelf space. To be successful, you had to be on the shelves of retailers like ComputerLand, CompUSA, Circuit City, Office Depot and MicroAge. Given the wide variety of hardware OEMs making Wintel-based PCs, both shelf-space for Macs and the technical know-how to sell them were severely limited, making a differentiation story like Apple's a hard sell. Today, Apple Stores drive a superior environment for consumers to experience hardware hands-on and get educated about the full breadth of Apple products. An aside, this is a consumer touch point that Google absolutely lacks.</blockquote>
Many years ago, I worked in PC retail. From that perspective, shelf space was not the issue for the Apple Mac. Compatability was the issue. Consumers wanted a machine that would exchange files with their work place, a machine that could install the games that the kids heard their friends talking about school. Consumers wanted a choice of printers, scanners, joysticks, and other peripherals. Limited choice <em>was</em> an issue, but not because of shelf space.

Moving to the present day, Mark also seems to be overlooking the massive mobile retail sector. Here in the UK alone, every major network has stores in most towns and cities, there are multiple independent vendors who cover all the networks and operate nationally, and a large ""grass roots"" population of independent stores operate. I would argue that <em>this</em> gives Google ample retail touch points for its Google mobile devices. Moreover, these are the places that customers go to get their mobile devices. If you want to upgrade your mobile, you necessarily don't go to one of Apple's stores. In reality, I think it is statistically unlikely that you do, primarily because your phone is nothing without a network. Certainly in the UK, people don't buy handsets. They sign up for contracts, from networks.

On this front, I would call it a nil-nil draw between the iPhone and Android. If we are talking purely about representation and we exclude the negligible benefits of the Apple store in <em>this</em> arena, both Apple and Android are represented in the places that average consumers are going to go. Android could arguably win this point one-nil on the basis that they have more handsets than the iPhone, but I think a draw is the fairest result.
<blockquote><strong>Pricing overhang</strong>: A primary reason for Apple's crushing defeat by Microsoft was Apple's misguided notion that it could charge grossly higher dollars for Mac products than Windows-based PC offerings. Contrast this with the present, where Apple is consistent in their assertion and awareness that it cannot and will not leave pricing overhang (i.e. a sufficient pricing gap between its products and the competition). This avoids the past dynamic where consumers saw picking Apple products as an either/or decision, in terms of price vs premier experience. iPod, iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad all have followed this course.</blockquote>
On this point, I can see where Mark is coming from. Historically, Apple have been an ""expensive"" choice. Expensive hardware, expensive peripherals, expensive spares, expensive servicing, etc. This is certainly something that Apple appear to be trying to address, although I would hardly call their products ""cheap"". The current pricing for the iPad, for example, as compared to comparable tablet and netbook devices is very high indeed.

If you compare ""pound for pound"" on hardware, there were phones with better specification that cost less than the iPhone on the day it was released. As Mark points out though, hardware is not the deciding factor. I wonder, however, if this will be the case forever. Apple's closed approach to their software mean that they are the only people investing in the platform for it. Want to create a ""budget"" iPhone, maybe without the GPS and with less storage, maybe a smaller screen? You can't. Apple can, but you can't. If you want to do this with Android though, the field is open.

So, at the moment I would score this as nil-nil also. Apple have certainly learnt their lesson, but I believe they may well be taught it again if a budget mobile phone builder picks up Android as an alternative to writing their own software, or a major brand such as Samsung throws its weight in.
<blockquote><strong>3. Developer ecosystem</strong>: It is a truism that in platform plays he who wins the hearts and minds of developers, wins the war. In the PC era, Apple forgot this, bungling badly by launching and abandoning technology initiatives, co-opting and competing with their developers and routinely missed promised milestones. By contrast, Microsoft provided clear delineation points for developers, integrated core technologies across all products, and made sure developer tools readily supported these core initiatives. No less, Microsoft excelled at ensuring that the ecosystem made money.</blockquote>
I'm with Mark on this one. It mirrors the logic by which I questioned the assertion made in point #1. Perhaps Mark and I agree after all.
<blockquote>Lesson learned, Apple is moving on to the 4.0 stage of its mobile platform, has consistently hit promised milestones, has done yeomen's work on evangelizing key technologies within the platform (and third-party developer creations - ""There's an app for that""), and developed multiple ways for developers to monetize their products. No less, they have offered 100 percent distribution to 85 million iPhones, iPod Touches and iPads, and one-click monetization via same.</blockquote>
Evangelism? Check. ""There's an app for that"" has hit the zeitgeist and shows no signs of leaving. In this respect, more than any other, it is unquestionable that the iPhone has been a game changer. People now <em>expect</em> to be to upgrade their phone with new features through apps, they expect quick and easy installation, and they <em>will</em> pay for applications.

However, to claim 100% distribution is incorrect. Apple's latest 4.0 version of the platform will not offer all facilities to all versions of the iPod Touch, iPhone etc. despite the fact that mobile phone vendors <em>and Apple themselves</em> are still selling these devices. The entry level iPhone, only recently hitting some UK networks, will not have all the features of 4.0. Therefore, if your software uses these features, the percentage of the market that you can access will be somewhat smaller than the 100% of 85 million devices that Mark claims. With mobile phone contracts running for eighteen months and upwards, this is a trend that almost certainly continue, especially as people pass on their first generation iPhones to other people as they upgrade. Today's new gadget is tomorrow's ""hand me up"".

Whilst many, if not all, of these problems will also be faced by Android devices, the prevalence of Apple's marketing and the rate at which they put new product into the market could exacerbate this. If Apple were really watching out for their development community, they would gear release cycles around the length of mobile contracts and provide better backward compatability.
<blockquote>Nested in every one of these devices is a giant vending machine that is bottomless and never closes. By contrast, Google has taught consumers to expect free, the Android Market is hobbled by poor discovery and clunky, inconsistent monetization workflows. Most damning, despite touted high-volume third-party applications, there are (seemingly) no breakout third-party developer successes, despite Android being around two-thirds as long as the iPhone platform.</blockquote>
I don't agree that Google has taught consumers to expect ""free"". Google Apps, Google Mail, Google Adwords, Google Checkout ... all of these services cost money. The Internet, in general, encourages a culture of free. From my own experience of owning an iPod touch and knowing many other people who own them, pay for apps are not as popular as Mark might have us believe. It is impossible to ignore that the most popular apps are also the free ones.

In terms of Google's Marketplace, I can agree with some of what Mark has to say. It is more difficult to find apps in this marketplace than it is in Apple's, although this hardly makes Apple's iTunes platform a paragon of virtue. It is <em>better</em>, but I don't think anyone could make a strong argument for it being <em>good</em>. It is simply the only option when it comes to adding apps to your iPhone or iPod. Apple train the user to accept it as it is.

And that, for me, is where my opinion parts ways significantly with Mark's. There is a fundamental and crucial difference between Apple's app market and Android's that Mark has ignored. One is open, the other ... isn't.

If you want to give away an app for the iPhone, you need the OK from Apple. If you want to sell an app for the iPhone, you need the OK from Apple. In a process shrouded in mystery, puportedly geared to protecting Apple's interests, and seemingly arbitary to many, Apple control what software you can and can't have.

On a piece of hardware you own, Apple dictate what you do.

If Microsoft did this, there would be uproar.

I appreciate that an impassioned argument about the difference between closed and open platforms is unlikely to sell any mobile phones. In my opinion, however, it doesn't have to. The openness of the platform, the low cost of entry for non-Mac users, and the popularity of Google in the development community will enable to Android to catch up and overtake Apple's app market. Simply put, if each platform has equal developers, Android apps will come out quicker.

Mark is right that there is no ""killer app"" for Android as yet. It has many of the killer apps of the Apple platform though, and there are more daily. If this marketplace can reach critical mass, it could emulate the mass appeal of Windows as a development platform and leave Apple floudering.

My score? One-nil to Android. The game is far from over, but I cannot see Apple undoing the fundamental mistakes that leave it at a disadvantage to Android in the long term.<strong> </strong>
<blockquote><strong>Consumer technology adoption</strong>: During the PC era, large enterprises essentially dictated the industry winners by virtue of standardizing on a given vendor or type of solution. This created a winner-takes-all dynamic, inasmuch as consumers would ultimately buy the same solutions that had been blessed by large enterprises. By virtue of its conservative nature (remember the motto, ""No ever got fired for buying IBM""?), staid Microsoft always felt like a safer choice than crazy Apple. And besides, accounting could solicit bids from multiple hardware vendors, which they liked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>By contrast, today's breakthrough adoption begins in the consumer realm and filters back to enterprises, not the other way around. This change deeply favors a consumer products and marketing force like Apple. While Google has done a reasonable job in the consumer arena, its approach is decidedly design-lite and techie focused, not mass-market friendly.</blockquote>
And in case you haven't noticed, Mark, accounting <em>still</em> like to solicit those multiple bids. In fact, it is fundamental part of the buying cycle. Apple don't have the floor here. In fact, if we are looking a business purchasing then we really need to add Blackberry to the mix. iPhones are not the rugged workhorse type of phone favoured by many businesses. An Android phone in the right casing with the right mix of apps however? <em><strong>An Android phone that IT can write apps for that plug into our internal systems? </strong>That's</em> a possibility.

Apple might be the desirable gadget here, but it is not the phone that the FD is going to stump up the cash for, and is not necessarily the phone that the CTO is going to get behind. Maybe Google <em>do</em> know who they are marketing to right now.

Of course, business is not the mass market so, to avoid falling into the same trap of mixing the two together ... what about the mass market appeal of Android?

I think the answer is ... consumers don't care. They don't care what operating system is running the phone any more than they care what processor is inside. What they care about are apps and, more importantly, <strong>services</strong>. Mobile phone marketing in the UK has focussed on the ability to access social networks such as Facebook and Twitter ""on the move"" heavily in the last year. Both HTC and Sony's latest Android offerings bring these services together with SMS and eMail in a way that leaves the iPhone standing.

In conclusion on this point, I don't think the business market will be as easily driven as Mark suggests, and I don't think that consumers are walking around with their eyes closed. They may not <em>know</em> that it is Android, but they know Facebook and Twitter and they want them in their pocket. Again, the Android community has its eyes firmly on the prize here.

I'm tempted to claim this as a victory for Android, I think more realistically this is another draw. At least at half time.<strong></strong>
<blockquote><strong>5. Microsoft-like resilience</strong>: I remember too well the Microsoft mantra ""Embrace-Extend-Extinguish,"" which basically meant that any segment worth owning Microsoft would ultimately dominate by the 3.0 version of its competing product. Part of this was a by-product of the incredible ""unfair advantages"" Microsoft had built for itself by virtue of channeling items 1-4 above. Part of this was its ruthlessness in squeezing the lifeblood out of competitors through any means necessary. But, give Microsoft full props for manifesting an unyielding resilience to keep working its product offering and market assault until victory was at hand.

Considering Apple's rise from the ashes to re-create a very profitable Mac business -- the dominance it has created with iPod and iTunes; the powerhouse iPhone and iPhone platform and the ambitious, and already well-regarded iPad -- does anyone wonder about Apple's resilience? By contrast, Google remains almost completely dependent upon search and advertising, despite launching so many new product offerings and seriously pursuing M&amp;A over the past several years. Arguably, Google's famously loosely coupled structure leads to a lot of seeds being planted, but so too, it seems to a less than laser-like focus on seeing those seeds to cultivation and full harvest. It begs the question, ""Can a tiger change its stripes?""</blockquote>
Apple certainly is a resilient beast, arguably the greatest phoenix in the industry.

Mark is also correct that the vast majority of Google's income comes from search and advertising. So, yes, they are ""reliant"" on this. What is not being pointed out here, however, is that this single source of income that Google are so reliant on has netted them <a href=""http://mashable.com/2009/10/15/google-earnings-3/"">a warchest of some 22 billion dollars in cash</a> as of October of last year. They have the cash to make the long miles on this one, just like Apple. (<a href=""http://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/3377294/Apples-warchest-means-security-Jobs"">In the interest of parity, Apple have a reported warchest of $40 billion in cash and securities</a>).

So, Google have yet to face tough times like Apple. Arguably, this is because they have yet to crash and burn as Apple so nearly did. Perhaps they will yet, perhaps they never will. Either way, coming back from losing one war does not make you better prepared to fight the next one.

At best, another nil-nil draw.

So, <strong>in conclusion</strong>, that's my take on things. I have tried to balance and temper my view, even though I set out to argue against what I viewed as a pretty skewed piece of reporting by delivering one of my own. Hopefully, seen side by side, there is a logical argument that can be constructed from the two opposing viewpoints.

I believe Android is behind, for the moment, but will catch up and overtake Apple's platform. I think the openness of the platform and the accessibility of it to hardware vendors will counter Apple's marketing and current market share strangle hold. Mobile hardware now has cameras, GPS, fast processors, plenty of storage. Making a better iPhone is about having better apps, and it is irrefutable that open platforms experience faster and more prolific development than closed platforms.

At least, in my opinion. Perhaps I'll be fortunate enough to get Tim's feedback on this."

I am very fortunate this year to be appearing on two panels, one at 12:00 and another at 13:00 on Saturday.

At 12:00, I will be taking to the stage alongside Gavin and Dan from The Sidekick cast for a panel called ""Signs and Portents"", based loosely on my new graphic novel ""The Dark"". The official blurb is as follows:
<blockquote>What do William Blake, symbolic code breaking, aura reading, Byron, Howard Hughes, numerology, World War Two poetry, and cutting edge science all have in common?

Find out as Gavin Jones and Dan Marshall (of The Sidekick Cast) probe the mind of Markosia word smith Chris Lynch and find out about his latest projects, including the critically acclaimed sci-fi thriller ""The Dark"", available in a limited edition Expo Exclusive edition this weekend.</blockquote>
Then, at 13:00, I will be sitting down for a ""fireside chat"" with the Orang Utan Comics crew and the inimitable Scott Grandison for the ""Comic Book Outsiders"" panel ...
<blockquote>Orang Utan Comics and Monkeys With Machineguns are successful small press studios putting out high-quality content for the last five years. Join them as they discuss their experiences in the business so far, give advice to others looking to produce their own titles and their view of the future for small press and independent comics in a world where digital distribution is becoming increasingly important.

Hosted by Scott Grandison of the Comic Book Outsiders podcast.</blockquote>
I will be flying solo this year as Stu.Art, the taller and some say better looking half of MWM, isn't able to make it to Bristol this year. Still, I'm sure I'll hold my own!

I haven't been on a panel since the very first Birmingham Comic Show when I sat on the Horror Comics Panel. Anyone who was at that event might remember be likening the realistic horror of The Walking Dead to Frank Butcher turning up naked on Pat's doorstep in Eastenders. In context, I was talking about <em>""the horror of the real""</em> and how brilliantly I think Walking Dead portrays the reactions of the human survivors. I think Charlie Adlard is still avoiding me though.

If you want a sampler of the sort of nonsense that I try to pass off as intellectual discourse, even some kind of pseudo-science at a push, you can delve in to the archives of yesteryear with ""<a href=""2009/05/13/an-evening-with-monkeys-with-machineguns/"">An Evening with Monkeys with Machineguns</a>"" and my guest appearance on ""<a href=""2009/05/14/orang-utan-comics-and-monkeys-with-machineguns-round-table-comic-book-outsiders-episode-46/"">The Orang Utan Comics Round Table</a>"" from Bristol 2009.

Micah Baldwin Thinks So.#
Micah Baldwin, CEO and co-founder of Graphic.ly, has been talking to CBR about his efforts to reach out to the rest of the digital comics business community (notably Comixology and Panelfly who are name checked) and start discussions on an open standard for digital comics that would allow a comic bought on one platform to be read on any other.

Vendor lock-in is one of my big objections to digital comics, and one of the things that I think the print medium still has over its virtual cousin. For me, one of the great joys of reading comic books is <em>sharing</em> comic books. It's a simple idea - you like a book, you recommend it to a friend, and you loan them your copy.Maybe they really like it, maybe they <em>love</em> it. Maybe you say ""Hey, no problem. Why don't you keep it?"".

There was a time when this was possible. There was a time when buying something meant that you owned it, rather than owning a license to it. If I buy a comic and I don't like it, I can give it to a friend, sell it on eBay, or drop it off at the charity shop. With a digital comic book, what is bought is bought and there is no going back. There are, quite literally <strong>no swapsies</strong>, and definitely no sharing.

This is because, in the digital world, ""Sharing"" is bad. ""Sharing"", in fact, has become practically synonymous with stealing. ""File Sharers"" are pirates, and pirates fund organised crime and drug trafficking. I don't know how my mix tapes I made by recording songs from the radio funded organsied crime <em>exactly</em>, but I am assured they did and I can apologise in retrospect. I was young, please forgive me.

Now, please, can we have a system that still lets me share my comics with my friends? Because Digital comics may be convenient, they may be cheap, but when we live in such a digitised world that simply exchanging items with another human being feels almost alien, almost taboo in some way, is that<em> </em>a price worth paying? Do you want to buy comics, or do you want to hold a perpetual rental license to some? I know what I want.

That is why I love the simplicity and purity of Micah's idea; that a comic once bought should be transferrable between platforms. It seems so obvious, doesn't it? As obvious, at least to me, as being able to pick up a print comic and walk to another room. And yet, I fear it is an idea doomed to failure.

When a number of IT industry players tried to agree an open standard for word processing documents, Microsoft went their own way. As the vendors of the most widely used word processing software, Microsoft knew that the best way to defend their monopoly was to ensure that documents written in their software, stayed in their software. Whilst their ""new"" file formats were open, they were <em>different</em>. Different enough to ensure that people played safe, and stuck with what they knew.

Spin the time-dial forward a few years and we have the advent of the iPod. Slick, polished, oh so cool and emphatically desireable, I doubt many consumers understood, or cared, about the DRM laden prioprietary file format that lurked under the iPod's polished veneer. Like a pretty new girlfriend with some deep seated issues, you weren't going to find out until you had the packaging off and you were far ... too ... committed.

To the present day and comics, more broadly eBooks, are the new battleground. With multiple hardware and software platforms jostling for position, it is a difficult and daunting task to select the right platform for your purchases. It is an important choice - Quite aside from the investment in the hardware, all of your purchases are going to permanently and inextricably tied to that device forever more.When you read, how you read, all tied to that device. And in case I haven't made the point firmly enough yet, I'd like to remind you of one certainty, ""Lynch's Law of Stuff"", at this point.

<strong>Stuff breaks.</strong>

If Micah and the team at Graphic.ly can catch the ear of this burgeoning industry though, we have a fighting chance. We have an opportunity to keep our community, to still <em>share</em>, without destroying the economic viability of the digital comics market and without funding organsied crime any more than any of us are already.

Step One is a format that all of the readers can utilise. A format that is well documented and does not use any proprietary software or standards that require licenses. This will open the doors to more developers, and take things forward. If you doubt that, just take a look at any other technology that has opened itself up to innovators and developers, then come back to this article. You'll be ready for Step Two.

Step Two is to create a system that allows us to move the comics between devices. Purely as a thought experiment, I imagined a sort of ""central registry"" for comics, a shared and open online system where your purchases are registered along with a secure and traceable but ultimately anonymous account. You register each of your devices to this central repository and each one that is registered can then download and read your purchased comics. For those concerned that people would register too many devices to a single account, limits could be placed on the total number of devices or the number of devices of a given type (e.g. you can have one mobile, one tablet, one laptop, one desktop). The comics reside on the devices temporarily, getting around the storage limitations of smaller devices and ensuring that the central repository is the ""master copy"" of your comics collection (remeber, <em>Stuff Breaks</em>)

If you want to share a comic, you ""loan it"" to your friend, using their account details. It stops working on your devices, starts working on theirs. As everything is tied to the central repository, they simply download their copy from there. When they are done with it, they send it back to you. It stops working for them, it starts working for you. If you want to sell a comic to someone, you ""transfer"" the comic on a permanent basis. If the central registry had some simple eCommerce facilities built in, you could even send and receive money through it. A small percentage, perhaps, would be taken by the registry to cover its running costs.

This isn't science fiction, it doesn't even mildly push the boundaries of what is technically possible with the very devices that you are using to read this article. A simple, self sustaining comics eco system. A comic shop for the 21st century, a level publishing playing field, and the freedom to move between platforms without fear of losing (or having to re-buy) your favourite comics.

It sounds simple ... doesn't it? I hope Micah's call doesn't fall on deaf ears."

If you want to get hold of one, you need to track me down with your copy of The Dark for signing or perhaps try asking one of ""The Darkettes"".

Yes, I have <em>Darkettes</em>.

I don't think you can get too excited about the Bristol Comic Con, can you?"

She's from Athens, she's slightly crazy (in the good way), and Rich McAuliffe and I have been fighting over her months. Brilliantly talented and producing a unique style of artwork, I've been lucky enough to work with Valia on the upcoming Insomnia ""Survial"" anthology and to get some behind the scenes peeks at her artwork for Rich's ""Snow"", also coming from Insomnia. She writes too, and she probably bakes. There's probably nothing she can't do.

So, why the outpouring of apprecation for this magician of the pens? Well, Valia has collected together the various short comic strips that she has worked on with a range of writers and collected them into <a href=""http://neurotic-elf.deviantart.com/journal/32194472/"">a short run anthology called ""Twisted Visions""</a>. Featuring Kostas A, Rich McAuliffe, Panos Panagiotopoulos, Sissy Pantelis, and myself, it's 104 pages of some of the most original and exciting artwork you're going to see anywhere. If you were one of the people who signed up to our <span style=""color: #ff0000;"">""<strong><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=190668378067&amp;ref=ts"">Valia Kapadai will kill you</a></strong>""</span> Facebook group, it is also your first chance to see the story ""Hypergraphia"" and to start plotting your revenge against me. Don't blame Valia, the world needs her more than it does me.

According to Valia's blog, there will only be 30 personalised copies, so make sure you search her out and pick one up. If you do miss out on Twisted Visions, try to pick up one of Valia's other books, they are all definitely worth your time and investment."

Before I write anything about this panel, I want to send out a huge thanks to both the boys from Sidekick Cast and to everyone who turned up to make the panel a success. We had some great questions, an <em>incredible</em> game of Secrets and Lies, and the whole process was made significantly less nerve racking and markedly more awesome by having a room full of friendly faces.

<strong>Gushing over.</strong>

If you missed the panel, other than a potted history of The Dark and MWM, some shameless plugging (including a new personal best for me), and some light hearted ribbing of a certain <a href=""http://stuartt1975.wordpress.com/""><em>missing monkey</em></a>, you probably missed me talking about codes, fiction, stories inside stories, fringe science, how thinly read I <em>really am</em>, and trying to answer some questions from people who had clearly thought about them beforehand. The swines. (Barry Nugent, I'm looking at you).

We had a lot of positive feedback about the panel throughout the show, so if you did miss it and would like to catch up, <a href=""http://www.sidekickcomicsuk.com/blogs/blog5.php/2010/05/26/sidekickcast-episode-41-signs-and-porten-2010"">download the ""Signs and Portents"" podcast today</a>."

With another year behind all of us, <a href=""http://twitter.com/PeteRogers"">Peter Rogers</a>, <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/idsharman"">Ian Sharman</a>, and myself all took to the floor to talk about our experiences as both publishers and creators, how we got started in the industry, and where we think we are going next. The differing approaches taken by our respective publishing houses/studios hopefully made for an interesting and thought provoking panel.

If not, you will get to hear me

	<li>Stretch a one beat joke about a table cloth way beyond its sell by date</li>
	<li>Somehow pull off a callback to a previous joke at the end of the panel</li>
	<li>Accuse Ian Sharman of ""Saying no, but meaning yes""</li>

Whilst some are territory related, there are a number of interesting ones relating to specific TV series.

My current favourites are <a href=""http://www.unit.org.uk"">http://www.unit.org.uk</a>, which has some interesting UNIT activity relating to the Chris Ecclestone era Doctor Who, and <a href=""http://jellyparties.co.uk/"">http://jellyparties.co.uk/</a>, which is the truly terrifying website of Psychoville's Mr. Jelly.

Most of the sites don't look like they have taken a lot of time to set up, although I suspect the awful state of Mr. Jelly's is the work of many hours for an ingenious designer. Perhaps I should make an FOI request myself as to how much time these sites take, and how many other people have found them before now?"

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Derek's environment suit creaked and hissed as he clambered awkwardly down the moss covered slope. Vines coiled around his boots with each step, snagging his ankles, constantly threatening to trip him and send him toppling head first towards the valley floor. A fall was the thing that all of the explorers feared the most. The environment suits were sturdy, but something about the atmosphere of this new planet made their joints brittle. They wheezed and groaned more than they should, and sometimes stiffened unexpectedly. Worst of all, the face-plates had become prone to cracking at the slightest impact. The soft crinkling of the plastic, the sudden whistle as the pressurised air escaped, these were the sounds that death made on this planet on the far side of everything.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> They had planned to use the suits only for the first few weeks, whilst they bodies adjusted to a new gravity and they convinced themselves that there were no dangerous toxins or virii lurking in what should have been fresh, clean, compatible air. A few weeks. That's what it <em>should </em><span style=""font-style: normal;"">have been.</span></span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> Six months into the mission, however, and the planet still had surprises for them.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;"">As the resident xeno-biologist, it was supposed to be Derek's job to catalogue the flora and fauna, in particular the vegetation. He had predicted viable food sources, even possible bio-fuels. So far, he had held only a single piece of native vegetation with an ungloved hand, and had spent three days in the infirmary as a result. As best he could now guess, the entire planet was completely toxic to human life. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> A thriving eco-system, full of seemingly boundless life and variety, and all of it poison.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> Derek suspected that was the reason they had just started calling it “the planet”. “New Earth” somehow stuck in the throat now. It was also the reason that all of them, with the exception of the Captain, had stopped sending messages home. What could make you send a message across the cosmos if all it was going to say was “We failed, you're all doomed.”</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> For all Derek knew, Earth was dead by now anyway. Either that, or Earth had abandoned its explorers and gone on to “Plan B”, whatever that might have been. In either case, the seven of them were the last humans that Derek was ever likely to see and, to him, that made them the last seven humans in the entire universe.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> The environment suit pinged, and a green dot floated across Derek's heads-up display.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> “Finally,” he muttered. He had been searching for the ship's engineer, Peter “Heavy” Hudson, for two hours; ever since Hudson's location beacon had vanished from the ships radar, along with his vital signs.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> The ankle joints of the suit cracked and gasped as Derek dropped the last few inches off the mossy slope to the valley floor. Beneath his feet, the crushed vegetation let out a tiny cloud of mustard yellow spores. Derek knew the spores well. It was the spores that had put him in the infirmary, it was the spores that caked every seam and joint of his environment suit. It was the spores that had fried the insides of the ships main drive, making escape from the planet impossible. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> What Derek couldn't work out was why every plant, every flower and creeper and vine and fungus on this whole planet released the same yellow spores. Yellow spores, everywhere he looked. Yellow spores, slowly encrusting everything.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> Except, it wasn't everything, Derek knew that. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> It was just <em>them</em>. Just the <em>humans</em></span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""><em> </em>Derek headed towards the green dot, carefully stepping over the gnarled roots and twisted vines. The yellow spores, seemingly caught his wake, drifted along behind him, landing one by one onto the environment suit. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> Crack, hiss, pop. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> Crack, hiss, pop. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> Derek might have found the sounds of his suit comforting, like listening to summer rain on a rooftop, if he hadn't been so terrified. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> Peter “Heavy” Hudson had been sixteen pounds over flight weight on the day of the launch.  They had all known about his weight issues, and his appalling impulse control. They were  indulgences the mission team would never had allowed, had it not been for the fact that half the technology in the ship was Hudson's design. They all knew that if they had a chance of getting from one side of the universe to another, any chance at all, it was only with Hudson on board.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> Two days before the launch, he'd given the mission a four thousand three hundred and twenty one to one against chance of success. Derek had made a note of it, it was the lowest odds that Hudson had ever given and he gave odds on <em>everything.</em></span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> Derek tried not to guess what the odds were that Hudson was still alive.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> Rounding the corner, he got his answer. Hudson was sitting in a small clearing of four inch high, dew kissed grass, strew with mustard yellow topped mushrooms. Sitting cross legged, letting a thin mist of yellow spores settle gently on him. Sitting with his helmet on the floor next to him.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> “Hudson!”</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> Derek's voice rattled the intercom as he reflexively called out his team mate's name. Without his helmet on, Derek couldn't be sure if Hudson had heard him or not. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> Derek raced awkwardly across the small clearing. The right knee joint of his environment suit let out a loud crack and refused to bend, leaving him dragging one stiff leg behind him. He couldn't hear any air leaving the suit, but over the sound of his own ragged breathing in his ears it was hard to tell. The suits amplified everything that you didn't want to hear.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> “Hudson!”</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> The engineer slowed turned, cocking his head as if the sounds of Derek crashing across the clearing were coming from somewhere much further away. His eyes finally focussed on Derek, a broad smile creasing his wide face. His eyes were glazed over, a mist turning them entirely white.  Juice from the yellow capped mushrooms ran from his lips and dripped from his chin.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> Derek came to a juddering halt.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> “What are you doing, Hudson? Get your helmet back on!”</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> Hudson raised his hand, and offered Derek a palm full of half chewed mushrooms.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> “Mush … room?” he slurred.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> Derek jabbed the radio controls on the forearm of his suit. Static filled him helmet, as if every joint and seal of his suit had burst at once. Whatever had blocked Hudson's locator was blocking Derek's radio as well.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> “Damn, damn,” Derek muttered, switching off the radio. He grabbed Hudson by the hand, scattering the half eaten mushrooms. Something squealed in his shoulder joint as he tried to haul the corpulent engineer to his feet. “Come on Heavy, help me out,” Derek gasped.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> “Mush … room?” Heavy asked again, groping with his free hand in the grass for more of the mysterious fungi. “Mush … room?”</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> Derek lost his grip on Heavy and stumbled backwards. His boots slithered underneath him on the wet grass, refusing to grip and, for a moment, the suit didn't make a sound at all. Derek held his breath as he felt his centre of gravity shift, and he knew that he was falling.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> With a thud, Derek landed flat on this back. He didn't breath out, didn't dare, concentrating instead on listening intently for any sound of air escaping his suit, any hint that the fragile plastic face plate might have cracked.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> He didn't hear Hudson plodding closer, and he didn't see Hudson pick up the twisted branch from the ground. He didn't hear the strange, alien sounds that came from the engineer as he crept closer to him. He didn't see the cloud of spores that burst from the mushrooms that littered the floor rush into Hudson's nose and mouth.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> All he heard, was a crinkling of plastic crumpling under pressure.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> All he heard, was a thin hiss as the safe, clean air of his environment rushed out.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> All he could see was a thin silver spiderweb, growing across his field of vision as his faceplate cracked.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> When Hudson's shadow fell over Derek, it was almost a relief.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> He held out a handful of mushrooms again, and cocked his head to one side. When he spoke, it wasn't with his voice, but none of his normal inflection or personality. It was as if someone else was speaking, someone else who had slipped on a suit made out of Hudson and was slowing getting used to the way that it moved, to the way that Hudson's bones and muscles and skin popped, and wheezed, and groaned.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> “It tastes … it tastes … tastes … a little like … grilled cheese …”</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" align=""left""><span style=""font-size: small;""> The mushrooms fell through the air, a rain of partly masticated fungus, as the thing in the Hudson suit raised the tree branch over its head.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: small;""> Inside the suit, Derek closed his eyes and listened as the gentle rain of pops and cracks  became a thunderstorm.</span></p>

This week, I saw an article on io9 about the glorious bemuzing covers of the horror and science fiction comics of yester-year. I was totally inspired by those covers and, in my normal fool hardy way, tweet out that I wanted to write a short story to go with every single one.

A few people, in <em>their</em> own fool hardy ways, said that I should.

So, welcome to the new POTP feature ""Cover Versions"", in which I present short stories/flash fiction inspired by those same 100 covers.

Our first story comes from the first cover ...

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">The hospital corridor was cold. The floor was cold, chilling Terry through his socks, and the walls were cold as he traced his fingertips along them to guide him in the dark. His breath didn't quite mist in front of him, but there was something icy and chemical tasting in the air that chilled the back of his throat and made his lungs burn. Yes, the hospital was cold. Cold, and dark, and utterly empty.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Except for Terry. And them.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">They were difficult to see, even though some of them were enormous. They had a knack for getting behind things, for bending and folding their monstrous shapes so they could be completely obscured by even the smallest or most mundane of objects. A tea trolley, or a table, a lamp, any of them could have harboured one of these impossible creatures. Coats were their favourites, of course, especially white coats like the doctors wore. They could make themselves so completely thin that someone could put on their coat and not even know that they were sharing it with someone, something, else.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">But Terry could see them, and they could see Terry.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Terry's shadow slipped up a wall as he stepped through a patch of moonlight. He could see the outline of his own bare legs, the flapping edges of his surgical gown. Terry hated undercover work. At least the shadow also had his tall, conical hat, and the unmistakable twisted shaft of his wand. Bare legged, shoeless, and bare backside not withstanding, Terry always felt like a wizard when he was wearing his hat.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">And a wizard he was, albeit an undercover one.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Reaching an intersection, Terry paused for a moment. The signs overhead made little sense to him. They were covered in long words, jumbles of letters. His father would have known what they meant, but he had vanished long before he had had an opportunity to teach Terry anything as useful as how to read the language of men. Terry wondered what the monsters made of the signs, whether they could read them either. If they could, which one would they follow?</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Terry chose the green one, and headed off down the dark corridor. Monsters liked green.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">The corridor had a sunny, seaside scene painted on the walls. Crabs the size of men ambled sidewards past children with strange, crude, expressionless faces and blank black eyes. Birds that looked like the letter V lurked, motionless, in a sky ruled by a vast yellow sun. Overhead, the lights had all been removed, leaving only the slowly tarnishing copper connectors and trailing strands of wire. Terry felt like he was creeping underneath the belly of some vast, corrugated slug, its various tendrils and appendages hanging down into his safe, seaside world. He shook is head, tried to purge the image.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">That was the problem with being a wizard; sometimes you saw things that weren't there. On the other hand, sometimes you saw things that really were there, but that were very good at hiding. Sometimes they were so good, it was hard to tell them from the things that really weren't there at all<span style=""font-style: normal;"">. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"">Suddenly, light illuminated the other end of the corridor. It skated up the wall, a pale disc at the end of a flickering beam. It raced closer and, behind it, Terry could see a shape, a shadow, moving closer. The beam of light spread as it moved closer, and Terry noticed footprints on the dusty floor. Footprints with only three toes, spread apart. Footprints that led straight into the wall, into the seaside scene.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">The light hit the wall, and Terry realised that one of the children, one of the black eyed featureless children, was missing. The monsters could make themselves flat. Flat enough to hide inside your coat while you were still in it. Flat enough to be a part of a picture on a wall.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"">Terry raised his wand, his hand trembling. But it was too late. A strong grip closed around his shoulder, and he realised that the shape behind the light hadn't been alone.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"">“Mr Johnson, there you are! We've been looking all over for you.”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"">Terry turned around. He thought perhaps he should recognise the young man in the white coat, but he didn't. He looked at his quizzically. Was he a wizard too? He didn't have a hat, or a wand, but he wasn't looking strangely at Terry either. If there was one thing that a wizard expected, it was to be looked at strangely, especially when wearing his wizarding hat.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"">The shape behind the light transformed in a very non-magical way into a middle aged woman in a nurse's uniform. She look flustered.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"">“I keep telling them to lock these old wards up if they're not going to use them,” she said. Terry presumed she was talking to the young man in the coat. “They're like a magnet for the inmates.”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"">“Yeah, well, at least we found this one in one piece,” the young man replied. “I don't think I could cope with finding another one like ...”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"">The young man's voice trailed off. Terry didn't know much about people, but he knew what it meant when they said something without saying it. It was, in its way, another breed of monster. The story that didn't need to be spoken to be told.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"">“Come on then Mr. Johnson,” said the nurse. “Let's get you back to bed.”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"">Terry always found it strange when people called him “Mr. Johnson”. It was his father's name, an adults name. Of course, when the nurse looked at Terry she didn't see him as he truly was. All she saw was a frail, old man in a backless surgical gown and insufficient warm socks for the time of year. Terry had tried many times to cure the ageing curse that he was afflicted with, but to no avail. One of the curses side effects was an enfeeblement of the mind, so much so that sometimes Terry couldn't remember who had cursed him in the first place.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"">That was why he concentrated on the monsters. They were simple.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"">The nurse took Terry by the hand and began to lead him down the dark corridor. The young man followed, and Terry wished he taken the chance to check the man's coat properly. There could be anything in there with him. Terry considered for a moment warning them, telling them about the monsters and the crabs and the black eyed no-face child who had been hiding on the wall.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"">Of course, he didn't. Every wizard knew what happened if you started telling people the truth. Every wizard knew how man treated the people who could see things that weren't there.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"">Terry's hat toppled from his head. He stopped to pick it back up, but the nurse had already dragged him forward. “Don't worry about your hat,” she said, her voice scolding. “You can make another one tomorrow.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"">Terry looked back. A wizard shouldn't abandon his hat. Down the corridor, in the dark, Terry watched as his hat slowly crumpled, squashed under the unseen foot of a thing that wasn't there.</p>

This is blog post asking for your support for a project that I'm involved in. I have written lots of blog posts like this. I'm normally shilling something, a new grahic novel, a new web site, or something else that I've created and now I'm hoping that you'll adore. I normally want your money too, as well as your love.

Today, I'm taking a break from the normal self promotion to try and help out a project that is hugely important to a lot of other people too. The project is ""Survival Stories"", and before I rattle on for too long, I'm going to let Peter Forbes pitch the project to you. He does it a lot better than I am about to.

<a href=""http://kck.st/cnQTwh""><img src=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/910305588/the-sleepless-phoenix-comics-anthology/widget/card.jpg"" alt="""" border=""0"" /></a>

Peter does a great job of navigating some of the thorny issues surrounding Insomnia at the moment. Insomnia made a big splash in the UK independent comics scene over the past two years, giving a lot of new talent a first shot at a publishing deal and giving a lot of more established creators a home for dream projects. Their tables are conventions were buzzing, and they reported great things. It seemed that the industry had a new and powerful player, one that creators were flocking to.

At the 2010 Bristol Comic Con however, things took a turn. There had been rumours circulating for some time amongst the creators that there were problems at Insomnia. There had been team changes, the loss of an investor/shareholder, and strange communications telling everyone ""not to worry, and not to listen to the rumours"". Of course, there is no more terrifying pair of words in the English language than ""don't worry"", especially when you don't know what you were supposed to be worrying about.

News was patchy at best, slowly breaking across news sites, via Twitter, and being emailed amongst creators. <a href=""http://megacomicnews.com/2010/05/sleepless-nights-for-insomnia-productions-at-bristol/"">MegaComicsNews.com has a good collection of Insomnia Publications news articles that broke.</a>

The end result was a publishing company that had disappeared in a puff a smoke, taking with it the hopes, ambitions, and dreams of a large number of writers and artists. For many, this was their <strong><em>break</em></strong>, their first opportunity to work with a known publisher and to bring their work to a wide audience. This was their weekends, their evenings, their nights. It was time that would have been spent with their families, their friends, and it was a million other tiny sacrifices all made in pursuit of the same dream. They just wanted to make good comics.

Of course, the comics still exist. There was no warehouse to burn down, no critical server lost. The problem facing the creators now is that their right to publish the work they have created is still tied, contractually, to the mouldering corpse of Insomnia Publications. In a ditch, somewhere, this decaying figure clutches to its breast sheaths of signed paper that give it, and only it, the right to publish what has been created under its auspice. No publisher will touch any of the material until the contracts are null and void and so, and the creators do not even have the right to self publish the material. The work is lost.

Sadly, this is not the first time a situation like this has occurred and so there are people who sacrifice <strong><em>their</em></strong> days, weekends, nights, and evenings in helping creators who find themselves caught in legal log jams. They're called the COMIC BOOK ALLIANCE. They have offered their time and support to the surviving Insomnia creators, and they are working diligently right now to try and resolve things amicably. Their work is tireless and ultimately they will not profit from it one iota. They are simply good people, passionate about the same medium that we are passionate about, who want to help creators do what they do best ... create. They are offering a chance to creators who will otherwise find themselves knocked back to square one, with anything up to two years of work lost in limbo.

You can help.

Your options are clear. <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/910305588/the-sleepless-phoenix-comics-anthology"">Pre-order Survival Stories</a> to support the creators and support the CBA because you find their plight moving. <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/910305588/the-sleepless-phoenix-comics-anthology"">Pre-order Survival Stories</a> to support the CBA because <strong><em>you</em></strong> might need them some day too. <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/910305588/the-sleepless-phoenix-comics-anthology"">Pre-order Survival Stories</a> because you want 192 pages of bloody good comics from creators who *just might* be the next generation of the UK comics industry. <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/910305588/the-sleepless-phoenix-comics-anthology"">Pre-order Survival Stories so that you can say ""I was there.""</a>

Or, let another piece of the UK comics industry die and drag down with the hopes of a lot of good people. If you go for that option, remember that you chose it."

The news broke several days ago now that <a href=""http://www.bleedingcool.com/2010/08/20/insomnia-publications-finally-gets-put-to-sleep/"">Insomnia Publications had released all of its creators from their contracts</a>. Everyone received a short, polite email from publisher Crawford Coutts, and thus ended many weeks of speculation, worry, and countless threats of violence. The rumour mill continues to rumble, with accusations being levelled at a number of individuals for their contribution to the publisher's downfall, and a number of people coming out of the woodwork to commentate on what had happened. As always, people were far wiser <em>after </em>the event.

<a href=""http://twitter.com/#search?q=insomnia%20markosia"">Some have called ""shenanigans"" on some of Insomnia's sales figures</a>. Some have claimed that an email from <a href=""http://megacomicnews.com/2010/05/sleepless-nights-for-insomnia-productions-at-bristol/"">Burke and Hare creator and ex-Vigil Editor Martin Conaghan, accidentally leaked by Rich Johnston at Bleeding Cool</a>, was the catalyst that started the whole, painful process. Nearly every publisher, be they small, indie, or none of the above, seems to have been offered a chance to purchase Insomnia. (I don't know if I'm glad or not that <a href=""http://www.monkeyswithmachineguns.com"">Monkeys with Machineguns</a> was beneath Insomnia's notice when it came to this. Some people say they are owed money.) Other people have spotted Insomnia products on sale either online or in shops and are wondering what will happen to the profits, if any, from this.

And, of course, a great many creators are happy and relieved to have their projects back in their own hands, even if that means they must begin the search for a publisher once more. To all of those creators, of which I myself am one, I wish the best of luck.

Personally, I am sad to see Insomnia fail. It was a brave, and noble, experiment. It gave a home to projects that may not have been, and now may not be, published anywhere else. It brought creators together and created a buzz that was <em>real</em>, even if it was fleeting. I hope that in time, as wounds heal and excitement dies down, people think more kindly about Crawford Coutts. Perhaps he was just someone who found himself suddenly out of his depth, who's creation became bigger than him and his ability to control it, and who ultimately could not feed the monster that he had created. Perhaps he had the very best of intentions, right until the end.

Think about it, wouldn't <strong>you</strong> hide from a bunch of angry comic creators?

I will admit, of course, that my reasons for hoping this are not completely altruistic. There are too few British publishers as it stands today, Insomnia's corpse yet another to fill the already our overflowing industry's mass-graves-behind-the-chemical-sheds. We need more people who have some sort of curious passion for printing, logistics, marketing, spending hours on the phone to retailers, spending more hours behind a stand at an expo, and then spending even more hours when they get home reading the multitudinous submissions thrust into their hands at the expo when what they really wanted was <em>your money</em> ... They are a rare, and beautifully masochistic breed. They put up our with our blown deadlines, our changes of heart. They are the ones who nurse us through our first broken hearts when a bad review arrives. They are the ones who put their money and time and skill into the pursuit of <em>our</em> dreams.

If there is someone out there, right now, thinking of picking up where Insomnia left off, thinking that perhaps <em>they</em> can make it work? I hope they don't read all of the stuff that is out there right now and decide ... ""Screw that, it's too much grief"". Because I know I would.

And yes, of course I know, they are no more full of altruism than me. But we need them. We need them more than they need us.

So, spare a thought for your publisher. As masochistic as they all surely are, they might just appreciate it."

Haven't written a flash fiction in a while, thought it might be good to get my hand back in!
<blockquote>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">Paul was an only child. He was also small for age, a little sickly, and blond. None of this, however, was important. What was important was that the was an only child, a lonely only child, but that it had not always been this way.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">Because Paul could remember a time when he had had brothers, and a sister. He could remember a time when he had had cousins who came to visit for the summer, and a best friend who lived two doors down. Paul remembered when there had been a school, instead of a quiet, empty building which was called whatever you called a school without children in it. The adults didn't seem to notice, and if they did then none of them would talk about it. It was as if every other child Paul had ever met was some elaborate imaginary friend, a complex delusion that seemed more real to him than the possibility that there were no other children in the village, and that there never had been.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">What convinced Paul more than anything else though, was the forest. Just as all the other the children had disappeared from the village, so the forest seemed to have crept undoubtedly closer. Vast, dark, and teeming with un-quiet and malevolent life,  Paul was sure that the forest had somehow swallowed up the intervening fields that had once sat between it and the village, that it had crept somehow closer while no-one was looking. He would go it, sometimes, when the adults were busy doing whatever they did that preoccupied them enough that they could ignore the fact that their children were vanishing. He would creep along its outer edge, where the grass in the fields turned dry and brown and papery, where the gnarled roots of the ancient trees twisted up around each other like snakes grasping for Paul's ankles. He wondered how trees so impossibly old could have moved, or sprouted here where once there had been only open, grassy fields. He would listen to the strange noises that emanated from within; the popping of branches, the crunch of leaves, the rasping whispers of wind squeezing between the densely backed trunks. He would listen in the hope that there might be an answer in there somewhere, that somewhere in the deep dark bowels of the forest that he dared not penetrate, might be the reason that the children and vanished and that he was so utterly alone.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">It was a nondescript day in August when the forest finally answered.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">The sun was high overhead, and it was one of the days when Paul found moments in which he could enjoy his isolation and forget for a moment that he was the only child in the village, the only child in his whole world. He was laying on his back in the long grass, a light breeze running low across the ground and turning the tiny patch of field that remained between the forest and the village into a bright green sea. He dreamt of being a pirate on the high seas, but had long since forgotten the faces of the other children that would have crewed his mighty pirate ship. They were nothing but blurs now, thick limbed creatures of his imagination with faces made of formless pink sponge.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">He was boarding a French trading ship when he became of the eyes in the forest, the eyes that were watching him. He caught a glimpse of them from the corner of his eye at first, freezing him where he lay. His pirate ship, and his sponge-faced crew, vanished in an instance. Captain Paul the Terrible was once again Paul the boy, and he was at the edge of the forest that took children.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">And it was looking at him.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">Painfully slowly, Paul stood up. He didn't turn his back on the forest for a moment, keeping his eyes on the patch of tangled roots a few feet below where the eyes were. The eyes did not waver, and did not blink. They just stared, two silver almond shaped eyes, staring out of the woods. Eventually, Paul lifted his gaze and looked directly into those strange eyes, those eyes that were right <em>there</em><span style=""font-style: normal;""> and yet so very far away. Eyes from inside, looking outside, eyes from wherever it was the wood came from. Eyes that were fixed on Paul and did not move.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Paul swallowed, mustering his courage. “Well,” he said, his voice never more that of a lonely, little boy than in that moment, “Are you going to take me too?”</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Without an answer, the eyes blinked, and were gone. No arms encircled Paul, no trees moved to grasp at him with their rough, wooden boughs. The earth did not open up, there were no thorny vines whipping out from the darkness to take him. There was nothing at all.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Just a boy, and a forest. A forest that didn't like sickly, lonely boys. A forest that liked a challenge.</span></p>

Ten stirred milk and sugar into her coffee as she awkwardly scrolled through the address book on her phone with her off hand. On the tiny screen, the time flipped to 14:53. Sarah was never late, and Ten really wanted to make her call before Sarah got here. Sarah was a good friend, but there were some things that she just didn't understand, and Michael was one of them.
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">Ten hit the green “call” button, and waited as the phone rang. And rang. The time flipped to 14:54, and Michael's familiar voicemail message sprang into crackling, noisy life. “Hi, this is Michael. I can't get to a phone right, so leave a message after the beep.”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">Ten sighed. It was hardly the most imaginative message in the world.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">“Hi Michael,” she said, still stirring her coffee. “It's just me. Checking in … I just wanted to let you know I'm doing fine. I'm meeting up with Sarah today, just for coffee. Everything's fine and, well … I miss you babe. Get in touch, OK?”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">Ten hung up, and quickly took a sip from her coffee, hoping the cup would somehow envelope her face her hide the tears that had slipped traitorously from her eyes. 14:57. She didn't want to be crying when Sarah got here. On an adjacent table, an elderly woman pretended not to be looking at Ten, and Ten pretended not to notice. She hated crying in public, but it had been so difficult lately, since Michael had come back into her life.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">It was 14:59 when Sarah walked in. If Ten had had a stop watch, she could have marked it as exactly 14:50 when Sarah dropped her handbag on the table. She truly was never late.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">“Hey, you OK?”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">Ten took another sip of coffee. “Sure,” she replied. “Coffee's hot, burnt my tongue.”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">Sarah raised an eyebrow. “Sure. Well, maybe I'd better get myself some of that. In case, you know, I want to burn my tongue as well.”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">Ten watched as Sarah breezed over to the counter and ordered. She watched her wait. Ever since Michael, she had become fascinated by the most mundane things. She wondered what was going on in Sarah's head at that very moment, what thoughts might be occupying her as she waiting for her cup of coffee. Ten's mind, at all times, as consumed with thoughts of Michael. She wondered, perhaps, how other people coped without him in their lives.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">“He left you too, you know,” Ten blurted the moment Sarah had returned. Sarah's coffee cup clattered the last two inches down onto the table.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">“Excuse me?”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">“Michael,” Ten continued. “It's not just me he left, is it? He left you too.”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">Sarah sat down. The elderly woman ceased even to pretend not be paying rapt attention to the scene between the two young women. Ten couldn't believe she'd said it. She'd promised herself that she wouldn't talk to Sarah about Michael. She'd promised Michael that she wouldn't talk to Sarah about Michael.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">Ten's phone buzzed in her handbag.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">“Don't tell me that's him,” Sarah said sharply. “I don't want to hear it.”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">“He wants to see you,” said Ten. She tried to keep her voice level, passive, persuasive. “He misses you too. That's why he came back.”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">Ten's phoned buzzed again, and she reached for her handbag.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">“Don't!” snapped Sarah. “Just … don't.”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">Ten slid her hand across the table towards Sarah. “Sarah, you two were so close. Maybe if you ...”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">Sarah pulled back, out of Ten's reach. “Listen, Kate,” she said, “Whoever it is you think you're talking to, it isn't Michael. I mean, you haven't even spoken to him, it's just text messages. It's some sick bastard's idea of a game, and it's being played on both of us. Michael's not back. He's not coming back. Ever. It can't happen.”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">Ten's phoned buzzed, seeming more insistent this time than before. Ten didn't reach for it. She didn't reach for Sarah. She just sat, motionless and utterly alone in her own thoughts. She had had the same doubts at first, of course she had. But Michael had left so suddenly, there was bound to be unfinished business. Unfinished business with Sarah, unfinished business with Ten.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">“I don't go by Kate any more,” said Ten, finally breaking the silence. “My name's Ten.”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">“His name for you,” said Sarah softly. “His 'Ten'”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">Ten nodded. “How would someone else know that, Sarah?” she pleaded. “How?”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">Sarah pushed her coffee away and picked up her handbag. “I don't know, Kate. I don't know how someone would know that. I don't know why someone would do any of this. But someone is. And you're letting them play you. You're letting them win.”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">“And if you're wrong?”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">Sarah stood and turned away. Ten could tell from the quaking in Sarah's shoulders that she was crying.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">“And if you're wrong, Sarah?”</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">And with that, Sarah was gone as well. Ten sat and watched her go, in doubt this time as to what thoughts were in her head. She hadn't wanted to upset Sarah, hadn't wanted to scare her. After Michael had died, she had been Ten's only link, her only connection to any of Michael's family or friends. Ten didn't want to lose her.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">The phone buzzed again, this time shaking the whole handbag.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">“Alright, alright,” said Ten, plucking the phone out. A tiny envelope spun around on the screen, the words “4 NEW MESSAGES” flashing underneath. Her hand trembling, Ten read them aloud one by one.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">“This isn't a game, please believe in me. I need you to believe. It's me, Ten, it's Michael. Please.”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">“I'm not gone. I'm not. Please believe.”</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">Ten stopped. She had realised that the elderly lady from the next table, now on to her second cup of coffee, was listening so intently that she had slowly drifted forward in her seat. Before Ten could say something to her, another message rattled the phone in her hand. Ten's brow furrowed as she read the message, then she smiled. Michael had always had a wicked sense of humour. She turned to face the woman head on, and read the last message.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"" align=""LEFT"">“And tell the old bat on the next table I'll be seeing her. Real soon.”</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">It always began with the most gentle of tappings. A soft percussion, an almost imperceptible rapping. She felt it, more than she heard it. A beat against her chest, a step out of time with her heart.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">She tried to ignore it. She had tried to throw it away. But somehow, some ... way, the locket always came back.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">The only certainty was that, every day, she would rise and place the thing around her neck. There were times when the weight of the thing seemed immense, as if it might snap her neck or drag her bodily to the ground. But still, she managed. She bore the weight. She carried the burden. The thing, around her neck, always gently pulsing and throbbing and aching for her attention.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Only once in a while, when the tapping had turned to banging, when the beat against her chest felt like the pounding of fists, when her mind and body were exhausted,would she open it.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">It always began with the most gentle of tappings. And it always ended the same way. It ended with trembling fingers opening the clasp of a simple, silver locket in some dark and furtive corner, and then words, hissed from within.</p>

After a last minute drop out from the 10thology book, Stu challenged me to put together a brand new story based on a set of illustrations. At least, that's what he told me. He might just be taking revenge for the bedlam that was MWM Live.

Either way, I thought I'd let you all see the first few paragraphs of the story as it shapes up.

There were four blocks of flats, thirteen stories each, arranged around a set of abandoned gardens. The shape, the specific shape of the towers and their gardens, formed an alter to a god long dead. Scorp’s grandmother said so, anyway.
<p style=""text-align: left;"">And Scorp’s grandmother knew things.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Like most things living, Scorp avoided the gardens. Scorp had his own place, down in the basement of Block Three, with the boiler, and with Fred. Fred had been the caretaker of Block Three for fifty years, right up until the day he died. Of course, he’d stayed on. Scorp couldn’t repair the boiler, for one thing.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">“Are you paying attention, lad?” asked Fred.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Scorp opened his third can of lager and took a noisy slurp. He was too young to drink, of course, but the one shop that was still open on the estate had an arrangement. They sold Scorp his lager, his fags, and his scratchcards, and he looked after them in return. There had been a time on the estate when Scorp had been just another one of those kids that you stayed away from, that you kept on the right side of if you didn’t want your car stolen or your door spray painted. These days, things on the estate were different. These days, people stayed on the right side of Scorp because one day, if they were really, really unlucky ... they might need his help.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">“I said ...”</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">“Yeah,” said Scorp, “I’m listening. You know, you talk a lot for a dead guy. I don’t get this much aggro from my mum, and she’s alive. Mostly”</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Fred fished a spectral bag of tobacco from the pocket of his ghostly cardigan and started to roll a cigarette. “I always thought these things would kill me,” he muttered, ignoring Scorp for a moment.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">“Yeah, well, you were hardly going to see werewolves coming,” replied Scorp. “I guess that was the problem though.”</p>

The cemetery on the hill had tall clouds of black smoke rising from it as Ray's truck pulled into town, but that wasn't unusual. This was Centralia, and everything here was either burning or falling down.

Ray checked his watch. The Armadillo was late.

From the back of the truck, there was movement. Awkward, jerking movement, followed by the cracking of bones and low, agonised moans. Ray's cargo was pulling itself back together, stitching together broken bones and regrowing lost flesh. That was the problem with the undead; every time you killed them, they found it a little easier to come back. Practice made perfect.

Ray was about to turn on one of his gospel CDs when there was a sharp rap at the door. The Armadillo was standing outside, arms folded and looking like he'd been waiting there for days.

Ray wound down the window. The smell of burning hit him immediately, the acrid bite of hot coal mixed with the unmistakable odour of undead flesh. At least it masked the legendary musk of The Armadillo, who looked like he hadn't seen a bath since the last time Ray had been here.

No more than five feet tall, the Armadillo was a strangely wiry creature. Bald and clean-shaven, with skin that was wrinkled in a way that didn't look like the result of old age. The Armadillo looked like he had once been a big man, but something unnatural had shrunk him down to what he was now, leaving his old skin wrapped around him like a secondhand coat. Ray didn't know why he was called The Armadillo, but he'd heard a rumour that the guy had once dug himself out from a mine collapse with his bare hands. Depending on who told the story, he'd been underground for anything from two days to two weeks. Of course, if you listened to some people, it wasn't his own hands he'd dug his way out with.

""What you got for me?"" croaked The Armadillo. He had the voice of an old man, croaky and cracking, but that could have been the smoke. Ray couldn't imagine what it would be like to live here, constantly under the clouds and dust. Reflexively, he pulled a fresh face mask from the glove box and pulled it over his nose and mouth.

""Some sort of zombie,"" replied Ray. He tossed a clipboard of paperwork out to The Armadillo. ""I think they called it a Class Four? Heals fast, I'll tell you that much. I had to go 'round back and break its legs three times on the way here.""

The Armadillo raised a dust encrusted eyebrow. ""What'd you use?""

""Sledgehammer,"" replied Ray, his voice muffled by the mask. He guessed The Armadillo would be used to it, he couldn't imagine anyone wanting the breathe the air in this place.

""Huh,"" grunted The Armadillo. ""I'm an axe man myself. Sever a few tendons, that's the trick. They always seem to have trouble growing those back properly. They're never quite the same. That's why so many of them ""

""I'll give it some thought,"" said Ray, with the unmistakable tone of a man who will do no such thing. He'd been a hammer man for ten years, and he wasn't going to change now.

The Armadillo pulled a thick tipped marker out of the pocket of his dirty overalls and ticked off a few pages in the paperwork before tossing it back to Ray through the open window.

""Looks in order,"" he grunted. ""Let's get him out. I've got my cart 'round back.""

Ray hopped out of the cab, dragging his sledgehammer off the passenger seat, and followed The Armadillo around to the back of the truck. The thing inside threw itself up against the wall as Ray passed, rocking the truck from side to side. Ray's grip on his hammer tightened.

Ten years. Another three, and his term was up. That was nine, maybe ten runs at most. Ten more runs and he was out. No more zombies, no more monsters, no more things that didn't even have a name. No more truck, no more Centralia, and no more Armadillo.

""You ... busy?"" Ray asked idly, as he fished the keys for the three padlocks that secured the back doors of the truck out of his jeans. Small talk was all part of the process, Ray's subconsciousness need to humanize this most inhuman of processes, his sanity boarding up the doors and windows of his brain.

""Too busy,"" replied The Armadillo, ""Time was, I saw one truck every couple of months. Now, I'm seeing two or three a week.""

""That many?"" asked Ray. He had assumed there were others, that he couldn't be the only person in his ... line of work. But two or three trucks a week, coming from all over the country?

""New recruits a lot of them,"" The Armadillo replied. ""Full of questions. Pain in my arse. And not one visit from anyone who can tell me what to do once the mine gets full.""

""It's getting full?"" Ray asked, snapping open the first two padlocks. ""I thought that thing went on forever.""

The Armadillo pulled a rusty old axe from underneath his heavy metal wheelbarrow. ""It'll probably burn forever,"" he replied. ""Anthracite vein's been burning since '63, but the mine is only so big. We pack 'em in too tight, they're not gonna burn right, and then all hell breaks loose.""

Ray slipped the third key into the third and final padlock. Inside the truck the thing had started to pound on the doors. Ray wondered if it knew what was waiting for it. As far as he had been told, the undead didn't feel pain, not in the way that humans did, but the thought of being trapped in a perpetually burning mine, your flesh constantly being burnt away only to regrow again? Living forever, burning to death every day? It was close enough to the description of hell that Ray had grown up with that he could even feel sympathy for the snarling, biting, hate filled thing that was trapped in the back of his truck. If he were a religious man, he would wonder if Centralia was really Hell on Earth, clambered up from beneath the soil to claim the dead that thought they had escaped the clutches of the afterlife and its judgements.

""What you gonna do when it's full then?"" Ray asked.

""Don't know,"" replied The Armadillo. ""If no one comes up with a better way of keeping these things down? I guess I start digging again, build a new shaft.""

""Guess so,"" said Ray.

He snapped the padlock open. The thing in the truck fell silent.

""You sure you don't want an axe?"" The Armadillo asked."

Belle fixed her hair in the mirror, carefully tucking away any stray strands of wiry gray that had escaped her hair clips and pins. She had had such beautiful hair once, but the years had been far from kind. Still, what girl wouldn't have a few gray hairs after a lifetime of deathtraps, alien invasions, mad scientists, would be global dictators, time travellers, and other assorted supervillians? No, the years had not been kind, but they had been magnificent.

The wheelchair, of course, was an inconvenience from time to time, but she refused to let anyone do anything about it. She'd lost her legs the day she'd lost Him, and by comparison the wound barely even registered. She had been the secret wife of the world's greatest superhero, its first superhero, and she felt his death as keenly today as the day that she had cradled his shattered body in her arms and lulled him softly into the endless sleep.

Belle sniffed, and held back a tear from her good eye. She wouldn't cry. Not today.

A breeze passed across the roof, and Belle heard the familiar sound of heavy booted feet landing on her balcony. She remembered how her heart had skipped a beat the first time she had heard that sound, the first time that he had visited her in the dead of night. There was no death that night, no tragedy, no battle to fight. There was a just a man, a glorious and impossible man, and the woman who had captured his alien heart.

""Mom?""

Belle turned and smiled. ""Hello, Able. It's good to see you.""

Able was almost identical in appearance to his father, a quirk of his father's alien DNA she suspected. Belle wished that there had been something more of her in the boy, but he was undoubtedly his father's son, at least in appearance.

""Come on in,"" she scolded, ""You'll catch your death out there.""

Able stepped gingerly into his mother's cramped apartment, closing the balcony door behind him.

""Mom, I've been to Pluto ...""

""So have I,"" Belle replied, ""And it's got nothing on a New York winter. Now, sit down there, and I'll get the tea things. Everything's ready for you.""

Able squeezed himself into an armchair, his massive frame straining the wood and fabric. His cape bunched up around the small of his back. ""Don't know how Dad ever sat down in this ..."" he muttered. ""This whole place is too small""

Belle shook her head and headed out to her small kitchen, her wheelchair creaking noisily. ""I saw you on the news yesterday,"" she called back.

""Oh,"" said Able. On the wall nearest to him were hung row after row framed photographs of his parents, others of his father with various superheroes, world leaders, and celebrities. Interspersed amongst them were newspaper clippings, recording Able's father's greatest exploits, and his mother's most famous headlines. Despite having eyes that could have read a newspaper across the solar system, he scanned the wall from top to bottom five times before resigning himself to the fact that there wasn't a single photo or newspaper clipping about him. His, of course, was a different kind of super-heroing. It lent itself less to headlines that a mother would want to pin up on her wall.

Belle put the tea tray down on the coffee table. Able recognised the pale blue china and green glass combinations, a wedding gift to his parents from the King of Atlantis. His mother loved the set, but to Able it made everything taste of the sea. Slices of Battenberg sat on plates shaped like seashells that no doubt made everything taste of fish.

Belle poured two cups of tea. ""You want to talk about it?"" she asked.

""No,"" Able replied, looking down at his boots.

Belle slid a cup of tea across the table to her son. ""Well, I do, Able. I need to talk about it. I need you to tell me what the hell you think you're playing at."" Her good eye was fixed on Able in a way he hadn't experienced since he was a child. A full grown man now, he understood why world leaders had trembled more at him mother's name than at his father's. Once a journalist, always a journalist, that's what she said. She had a nose that was only every comfortable where it wasn't wanted.

""What do you mean?"" replied Able, defensively. He picked up his cup and slurped tea. As he had expected, all he could taste was brine and salt.

Belle clinked her cup down noisily. ""You know exactly what I'm talking about Able. I'm talking about you bulldozing shanty towns and refugee settlements. I'm talking about you walking ahead of tanks instead of standing between them and innocent people. I'm talking about you taking sides, and the wrong sides at that. That's what I'm talking about.""

""Sides?"" said Able angrily. ""Come on, Mom. All Dad ever did was pick sides. You can't have truth, justice, and the American way without America, and these people are America's enemies.""

""Who says?"" Belle spat back. ""Who says that their our enemy?""

""Oh, I don't know,"" said Able sarcastically, ""How about the President?""

""The President? Oh please, Able, I thought I raised you better than that. You're the Government's whipping boy now?""

""Mom, Dad worked for the President all the time. It's up on the wall, right there!""

Able stabbed a finger at the wall, sending a tiny wave of pressure out that rattled the pictures on their hooks. Belle frowned. Able had never had the control over his powers that his father had had. There was something reckless about him, like a child playing with a gun without understanding what it is and what it could do, without realising that real guns kill people for real, and nobody gets back up to carry on playing. Perhaps that was the problem; Able's father had died and come back to life so many times when Able was growing up, all of their friends had at least once too ... Belle wondered if Able had a real understanding of what death was even now. Growing up around superheroes, perhaps it was natural to think that death was something that only happened to other people.

""It was a different time,"" said Belle, lowering her tone. ""We'd just come out of a war, things were ... simpler.""

""We're at war now, Mom,"" replied Able. ""There might not be bombs falling on Pearl Harbour, but we are at war.""

""And those people, in that village?"" asked Belle, ""Were those people at war too?""

Able stood up and unclipped his cape. A patch of damp sweat had stained it dark red around his neck and between his shoulder blades.

""Is it hot in here?"" he asked, catching his breath.

""Heating's on full,"" Belle replied. ""New York winter, can't afford a chill at my age.""

Able slumped back down into his chair, the wood cracking under his weight. He ran a hand through his dark hair and rubbed his eyes. ""I don't feel so good.""

""Don't change the subject,"" pressed Belle. ""I want to understand what you thought you were doing, why you did it Able? The whole world saw you. The whole world. It's been on every news station, every channel, for days.""

Able looked up, his eyes rimmed red. ""Is that what this is about? Your precious pride? Your reputation?""

""Of course not,"" replied Belle. ""It's about you, and what you did.""

""Crap!"" spat Able. ""This is about you, and about him, just like everything else in my life. You don't mind people knowing your my Mom when I'm pulling cats out of trees and stopping bank robberies, but the minute I try to do something that's going to make a real difference, the minute I try to do something that might actually change things ...""

""It's not your job to change things. It's not your job to decide who wins a war, who runs a country.""

""But I can decide who doesn't? How many would be dictators have I stopped? How many people with plans for world domination? Who says that one of them, just one of them, might not have actually made things better? Maybe one of them might have made the world work. I have to make decisions every day on who to save, who to stop. Who wins, who loses, it all comes down to me.""

""Your father could always tell right from wrong. He always knew the right thing to do.""

""And so do I!"" Able shouted, rattling the windows of the apartment. ""But you know what? You're right. Why should I help a President win a war, when I could win it for myself. Maybe that's the mistake that Dad made, for all those years. Instead of spending all his time stopping one supervillian or another from taking over the world, maybe he should have just taken it all from himself! You think that this was the first time that I had to do something like that? You think that I haven't done that before? How the hell do you think those cameras were there in the first place? I can hear atoms rubbing together, you think I can't here someone switch on a camera? We've been doing it for years, Mom. We just decided that it was time people saw what they're really up against when they mess with America. Me, Mom. They're up against me!""

Able slumped in his chair, as if his rant had sucked all the air out lungs that could hold enough air to carry him across space. His hands were trembling.

Belle shook her head sadly. ""Oh, Able. I wish you hadn't said all that. I'm so, so sorry.""

Able's head drooped forward for a moment. ""Sorry?"" he said, the word slurring as his lips suddenly started to puff up. He raised a hand weakly to his throat, trying to pull his close fitting uniform away from his neck.

""Yes, baby, I'm sorry,"" said Belle. ""I'm sorry for whatever it was I did, or didn't do, that let you grow up this way. I'm sorry that you can't see that what you did was wrong, so very wrong. I'm sorry that you're already so far down this path, that I don't think you can come back. I'm sorry that I have to stop you.""

Able tried to stand, his legs trembling and weak. Collapsing forward, he smashed through the coffee table, sending Atlantean crockery flying up into the air. Belle wheeled herself gingerly backwards, until her eye met his.

""Those people weren't supervillians, son. They weren't even criminals. They were just people. Men, women, children. People who were looking for somewhere to live, people who believed that the land they were standing on was theirs. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't, but is it really for someone a thousand miles away to decide where their borders are? Is it your right to kill them, just because of where they were standing?""

""What did you ... do?"" croaked Able. His eyes had all but closed up, and he relied on his flickering and quickly fading X-Ray vision to see his mother. Her skeleton looked down at him from her wheelchair. He'd never realised that she had so many broken bones, so many injuries.

""I poisoned you,"" Belle replied. ""An obscure radioactive isotope from your father's home-world. We cleaned up the last of it on Earth years ago, before you were even born. Your father gave me some, for emergencies. In case he ever ...""

""Flattened a village?"" quipped Able. With the last of his dying vision, he thought he saw the skeleton smile.

""You have your father's sense of humour,"" Belle said. ""I'll miss that.""

Belle rolled herself closer, until her wheelchair was butting up against Able's powerful frame. Carefully, she lowered herself down onto the floor, and positioned herself next to him. She stroked his hair gently.

""It will be alright, son,"" she whispered softly. ""It won't hurt, your father promised. He said that I had to watch you, just in case. He said that you might grow up with a little too much human in you, that the power might be more than you could understand.""

Able groped with a quivering hand until his fingers found his mother's hand.

""I'm frightened, Mom,"" he croaked. ""I've never died before.""

""Me neither sweetheart.""

Blind and paralysed, Able lay on the floor and listened with the last of his super-hearing to his mother's heart stop."

Doctor Guest sat and drummed his gloved fingers on the clear Perspex table of the interview room. His seat creaked underneath his as he shifted his weight around, the biohazard suit uncomfortable and hot. It all seemed so unnecessary, but there were still some people who doubted his abilities. Mostly, there were people who sold medicine.

Or at least, they used to sell medicine. Their reign was now long past.

The guard had said he'd be ten minutes, long enough for Doctor Guest to ""get ready"". The truth was that Guest didn't time to get ready. Getting ready would imply that, in some way, his ability could be switched on or switched off, that he somehow could stop hearing all the tiny little voices that had been his constant companions since he was a child. The tiny little voices that he had learnt secrets from, the tiny little voices that he had betrayed.

Sometimes, he wished that he did need to ""get ready"". But he didn't. And even now, two miles above The Dungeon, he could hear them. They knew he was here. And they were angry.

There was a knock at the door.

""Come in,"" said Guest, trying once more to straighten himself out and get comfortable in his seat.

The guard opened the door slowly, his own biohazard suit making his movements awkward. He lumbered in, holding a sealed petri dish gingerly in the thick, rubber clad fingers of both hands. He was nervous. It had been years since anything came out of the dungeon, and the pale young man behind the greasy visor of the hazmat suit had probably never heard of half the things that were prisoners here. He had probably never been ill a single day in his adult life either, and all because of Guest and what he had done.

""Put it on the table,"" said Guest. The suit made his voice echo. He would be glad when he didn't need to use his voice to talk. He hated the way that he sounded using human words.

The guard gingerly put down the petri dish. ""Shall I ... shall I open it?""

""No, probably best not to,"" Guest replied, with what should have been an inaudible sigh rattling around inside the hazmat suit's cork-shaped helmet. ""I'll do it once you're outside.""

""Outside?"" asked the guard, his voice trembling just a little. Guest guessed that was the first VIP the guard had ever dealt with. ""That's not the protocol, Sir, I ...""

Guest clasped the petri dish in his own gauntlet clad fingers.

""Son,"" he replied, ""I wrote that protocol. I also wrote the protocol on how often these hazmat suits need to be tested. It got rewritten a few months later, to cut costs. So, if you're happy that the accountants know more than me about how to deal with this stuff, stick around. If on the other hand ...""

Guest left the sentence hanging in the air as the guard scuttled, crab like, out of the room, closing the door behind him. Guest counted to sixty, just in case the guard recovered his courage and returned, but he didn't.

""Thank God for that,"" muttered Guest, pulling off the thick hazmat gloves before releasing the neck clips on the helmet. There was a hiss as the filtered air escaped. Guest took a few deep breaths, tasting the stale air of the interview room. He felt nervous. Even though he knew it wasn't possible, he started to convince himself that their voices, the tiny voices, had gotten louder without the helmet.

Gripping the lid of the petri dish, Guest twisted, and let diphtheria loose into the air for the first time in almost a decade.

He waited. There were no words, but with whatever passed for body language in the microbiological world, Guest could sense the diphtheria stretching out, filling the space, like a long haul traveler finally arriving at their destination.

Finally, it spoke.

""Are we alone?""

Diphtheria's voice rattled around in Guest's head like pennies in a tin. It was so much louder, close up. He had forgotten, as impossible as it should have been, he had forgotten. Parts of his brain that had been dormant for years awoke with a start, and all the tiny voices grew louder in an instant. Guest focused, remembering instinctively all the old techniques. Remembering how to control it, how to marshal his thoughts above the cacophony of the microscopic world.

""Yes,"" he replied, his own voice booming in his head. ""This is a clean room, there's just us here.""

""I can hear the others,"" replied the germ cloud. It tickled the edge of the only door, bumping against it like a fly against a pane of glass. Guest couldn't see it, but some other set of senses told him where it was and what it was doing. It was its very nature, the inescapable purpose of the thing. It wanted to spread, to breath, breed, consume, and grow. He envied the germ its simple honesty.

""Yes, we can hear them, but they can't hear us. I used a room just like this, back in the beginning. It's safe, you can trust me.""

Diphtheria drifted back across the room, settling back around its dish. Somehow, Guest knew that the germ was sulking.

""The others don't sound like us,"" said the cloud. Germs always referred to themselves in the collective. There was no I, no me. There was only us, and by contrast, only them. Another beautifully simple conceit that Guest envied. He had never found his own place either in the world of men or the world of germs. He was an alien in both, a singular I, a singular me, who could never be anything else. Guest had never been ""we"".

""No,"" replied Guest, ""That's because you are the last. You're the last diphtheria in the world.""

""We don't understand,"" replied the germ cloud. ""Where are the others?""

""Cured,"" replied Guest. ""Gone.""

He waited. Mortality, worse extinction, was not a concept easily communicated across the gulf between man and microbe.

""You?"" asked the cloud. The tiny myriad particles had settled back down inside the dish now.

""No,"" replied Guest. ""Not me, but people who used my research, my discoveries, my medicines. People who used me.""

The cloud said nothing in response, at least not in words or microscopic actions that Guest's strange, wild talent could translate into human thoughts, human words, human concepts. It was moments like this when Guest still found his power frightening, when he had to face that reality that for all his vaunted ability to speak to germs and microbes and virii, there were words, concepts, for which there was no human equivalent.

""Your ... fault."" said the cloud. Guest could feel a pressure behind his eyes, a familiar migraine as he brain slowly cooked in his skull. It felt like coming home, and he indulgently wished that he could sneeze, or cough, or feel the damp rattle of mucus on his chest.

""Yes,"" he answered. ""My fault. I was a fool. I wanted to create a harmony, a world where man did not fear illness, where we understood ..."" he began to blather, his talent breaking down as he fought to translate his thoughts.

Eventually, Guest's guilt found its voice. The story did not need to be told, the explanations did not need to be made. Guest felt himself move into the collective mind of the germ cloud, to a place beyond his so human concept of right and wrong. To a place where there was only life, only growth, and all other things were not the purpose of ""we"". All other things, guilt and betrayal and sadness included, were something only ""they"" experienced.

""I am sorry,"" said Guest, breaking the link. He realized he had been holding his breath. ""Can you forgive me?""

""We must grow,"" was the only reply.

Guest smiled. ""Yes,"" was his simple reply.

Taking the petri dish in his hands, he lifted it to his mouth. There was a think mucus spread inside it, the meager food given to the dungeon's microscopic prisoners. Guest breathed deep, and felt the diptheria hit his lungs immediately.

It felt like an embrace."

""She's a beauty, isn't she?""

The words rolled off the saleman's tongue as smoothly as the motor home had once rolled off the production line. It was well worn patter, with almost as many miles on it as most of the salesman's stock.

""She's seen better days,"" replied David, kicking one of the front tires. David had no idea why he did it, it was just something he'd seen people do when buying a vehicle. Still, the rubber was reassuringly firm, and that had to mean something. Probably.

""Ah, her best days are yet to come!"" the salesman continued. ""Machine like this? She's not really broken in until the first hundred thousand miles are on the clock. Trust me, that's when she really starts to purr.""

David ran his hand along the armored bull bars that covered the grille and the first third of either side of the motor home's cab. He felt dents, and something wet.

""Those bars are top rated,"" the salesman said, pre-empting David's question. ""Heck, you should have seen what we scrapped off them when she came in ...""

The salesman stopped. He was wise enough to know when he'd let out a little too much line, and his fish was in danger of slipping the hook. He changed tactics, quickly, before David could ask any awkward questions.

""Where you going, anyway?""

""Providence,"" said David. It felt strange to say it out to another person, after all the weeks of planning, the months of hoarding, bartering, trading, and the years before that of wishing, wishing that he could be out of this place.

""Providence ..."" the salesman repeated, and let out a long whistle. ""Wow. That's a long way.""

""My parents live there,"" said David. ""Besides, I've heard that if you can make it past the first checkpoint, you can get a free ride, anywhere in the country. Anywhere you want to go.""

""Yeah? Heck, maybe I ought to give it a try myself.""

David bristled. ""You've got to have family, that's what I heard. You can go anywhere, as long as you've got family there to stay with.""

""Ah, right,"" replied the salesman. ""Well, that's it for me then. All my family lived right here. Guess that's true of most folks. We were a small town ...""

""That's what made it so easy for them,"" said David. He pulled open the door of the cab and climbed up. Inside, the motor home stank of cigars and beer. There was blood splattered over the driver's seat. ""That's what made it so easy for them to do what they did. Nobody missed us. Nobody cared. Just another town that dried up and blew away.""

David climbed across to the passenger seat. In front of him, a mounted machine gun hung awkwardly. ""You got ammo for this?"" he asked.

""Sure, sure,"" said the salesman. David didn't noticed the crack in the salesman's voice, or that he had turned away from a moment. He didn't notice the tears as they hit the dry, dusty ground. ""I'll throw in a few clips for you, how does that sound?""

David hopped down from the cab.

""Deal,"" he said, trying to contain a sudden surge of excitement. This was it. He was going home.

""Great,"" said the salesman, his composure returning, the thrill of the sale overtaking him. ""Come up to the office, I'll get the keys.""

David followed the salesman towards the portacabin that served as his office.

""Can you do something for me?"" the salesman asked, as he unlocked the office door.

""What?""

""When you're out there, on the road? Kill as many of those mutant bastard as you can for me.""

""Sure,"" said David, with a nervous smile. ""Every one I see between here and Providence."""

A lot of Android users are complaining online about Android's Dialer storage application using up too much space. Struggling for space on my HTC Desire, I cleared my dialer storage today.

As best I can work out, Dialer Storage is where Android text messages, picture messages, and call history are stored. There are notes on-line complaining is a long standing bug in Android that allows the data in Dialer Storage to run amok, eating up your Android phone's precious internal storage. Turning down the limits on message storage doesn't seem to produce a quick fix, as much as it looks like it should.

Clearing Dialer Storage data, through the Android Application Manager initially appeared to do nothing, other than clear the warning about limited space from my home screen. All my text messages and photo messages seemed to have survived as well. So, where did the space go?

Well, my messages did eventually disappear after I restarted my phone, so I guess these were maybe hanging about either in memory or in some sort of deleted state, cleared on my reboot. What was less obvious was that clearing dialer storage also deactivated my internet access point selection. My access point configuration was still in place, but my choice of default access point had been lost.

If you lose Internet access after clearing Android Dialer Storage, here's a fix.
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong></li>
	<li>Go to <strong>Wireless &amp; Networks</strong></li>
	<li>Scroll down and select <strong>Mobile Networks</strong></li>
	<li>Click <strong>Access Point Names</strong></li>
	<li>Click on the empty circle next to access point name, turning it green.</li>

Your Android internet access should now be restored."

Jackson skidded to a halt, the rough ground under his cycle's tires crunching and kicking up dust. He was at least three miles further down the wall than anyone else had ever been. There wasn't a tag in sight.

He hopped from the cycle and opened up the right pannier. Two rows of spray paint cans looked up at him. Excitement and fear bubbled together inside him. He wondered if Da Vinci had felt this way, looking down at his palette before making that first mark on a virgin canvas.

Of course, Da Vinci hadn't been a refugee, or an outlaw.  Da Vinci didn't spend every minute looking over his shoulder, watching out for Scalpers and Skinners. Da Vinci didn't sleep under an old bridge, taking turns on watch on a three hour rotation, and foraging for food in the abandoned malls and warehouses on this side of the wall.

Yeah, Da Vinci didn't have The Wall.

Jackson pulled out a black and a red and began shaking the cans, the familiar clatter from inside them quickening his heart. He'd been tagging for six months now, his tiny contribution to the resistance movement, and every time still felt like the first time. He didn't know what difference it made to the resistance, but he knew that the Scalpers and Skinners hunted taggers, and that was enough indication that it was worth doing. Anything that took their time and their attention away from the wall, anything that stopped its inexorable climb skywards, the endless building and fortification.

He knew he was painting a target on his back, but that was the point. Come on, you bastards, here I am. Come on, come down and get me. 

Three miles further than anyone else, and still the wall stretched over the horizon. Perhaps it didn't have an end. Jackson knew that was impossible, but a lot of impossible things happened these days. 

Jackson popped the plastic lids off the scans and began to spray the outline of this tag onto the wall.

Three miles further than anyone else.

Come on, you bastards. Beat that."

Oscar and Meredith watched the cave people drag the carcass of the creature into the cave. They couldn't be sure what is was, something between a cow and a frog perhaps, it's face clearly bovine, but it's leathery skin and splayed back legs those of another creature entirely. One of the cave people sliced into the frog-cow-thing's belly, and a milky froth of eggy spawn spilled forth. The cave people descended on it greedily, scooping up the warm, steaming mass and shoveling it into their mouths. It ran between their fingers and ran down their chins, growing cold and gelatinous in moments.

One of the cave people, a young female, carried a handful of the strange goop to Oscar and Meredith and offered it to them, her head bowed reverently.

""Take it,"" whispered Oscar. ""It's an offering.""

""You take it,"" Meredith hissed back, ""It's disgusting.""

With a sigh, Oscar helped the cave-girl drop the cow-frog's spawn into a rough hewn stone bowl. She looked up only once, daring to steal a glimpse at Oscar, and offered a grin full of black, rotten teeth when her eyes met his. Oscar smiled back instinctively.

""Looks like you'll be warm tonight,"" said Meredith bitterly.

""Don't be ridiculous,"" Oscar replied defensively, ""She's just a kid, what's wrong with you?""

""Look around you, Oscar. Look around you and take your pick.""

And Oscar had to admit, life in the cave was not getting any easier. The cave people kept them fed, and kept them safe, that was something, but Oscar could feel the weight of expectation upon them growing with each passing day. The cave people watched them guardedly now, and the offerings had become smaller. The younger ones knew no better, of course, but Oscar wondered if some of the older ones were starting to remember, starting to piece the picture together and realize that things weren't right. After all this time, was it possible that they could remember?

""Well, if you want to take your chance outside,"" said Oscar. ""Best of luck. Looking at that thing down there? I'd say radiation is still a bit of a problem.""

Meredith stood up, throwing the heavy furs and skins that had been draped across her to the floor. ""One of these days, I might just take my chances.""

As she turned to stalk off to one of the more remote corners of the cave, she found her way blocked by two cave men. They looked at her, tilting their heads from side to side, as if they had noticed something new about her, something they were seeing for the first time.

""Oscar?""

""It's alright,"" Oscar said reassuringly, placing his hands on Meredith's shoulders and guiding her back to her spot next to him. ""They just want their reward for being good hunters, don't you boys?""

The larger, and bolder, of the two cave men grunted in reply, and stabbed a finger towards Oscar.

""Yes, yes,"" Oscar said patiently. ""Gather yourselves together, and we'll all worship together.""

The cave men grinned, and loped off to gather the others.

""You are way, way too into this,"" said Meredith, burying herself once more under a mound of furs. ""You're getting sucked into their world, you know that don't you?""

""Our world is gone, Meredith,"" Oscar replied. ""What do you expect me do? It's their world or nothing.""

Meredith made a huffing noise and pulled her furs up to her chin. ""Just keep the noise down, and make sure those monkeys know not to try and touch me in my sleep.""

""I'm quite sure they wouldn't dare,"" replied Oscar, pulling a dirty sports bag out from under his own pile of skins. ""You're the Shaman's woman, after all.""

Meredith didn't answer, but Oscar could feel here eyes on him as he unzipped his bag. There was a gap on one side where a badge of office had been stitched once. Oscar missed it now, another thing from the world before forever lost, but he knew that he could not have stood seeing it every night. The cave people had gathered in a rough semi-circle around them both now, waiting patiently. A few of them were chewing on chunks of meat they had cut roughly from the cow-frog's belly, and Oscar fought back a mouthful of bile as he lifted the small portable television carefully out of the sport's bag. Gingerly, the eyes of the tribe fixed on him, he slid in a set of batteries and switched it on.

""This the emergency broadcast system. Stay in your homes. We will provide instructions as soon as possible. For your safety, remains indoors. For your safety ...""

Oscar drifted off. He had heard the announcement a hundred times over. It never changed. There were no instructions coming, and there were no homes to stay inside anymore. Somewhere, a machine was still calling out to other machines, and that was all of society that was left. One day, whatever kept this system running would be gone, and that would be it. The last vestige of the modern world would be an unpaid utility bill.

Looking at the cave people, he wondered who the lucky ones were. The young ones, born after the war, or those who simply couldn't remember that there had a been a war anyway. Had it been the bombs, or perhaps the great gas clouds that had swept across the country in their wake? Maybe the radiation, which surely twisted the brains of people as easily as it mutated the flesh of animals, Oscar reasoned.

Whatever the cause, one things was certain. Oscar could never, ever, tell the cave people that it was all his fault in the first place.

Meredith opened one eye. ""Goodnight, Mr. President."""

Wade drummed her painted fingernails on the steering wheel of the car. She hated this; a darkened car park, waiting for a mysterious informant, grinding her teeth because this was the week she quit smoking. She could feel her life descending into cliché. She felt flattened out, two dimensional, as if she was nothing more than one of the grainy telescopic lens photographs that her newspaper would have printed, and not a real person at all.

""Stop it,"" she admonished herself. ""Get a grip.""

Wade wasn't given to flights of fancy normally, but her life had recently taken a turn into the bizarre and somehow, some way, likening herself to a photograph, wondering if she could be living on the printed page and not in the real world at all ... well, she'd seen and heard stranger things in the last few months.

It was that damn inquiry, and all the new laws that had followed, that had changed everything. Now the censors were everywhere and investigative journalists like Wade were a dying breed, literally.

Still, the money was good.

Half an hour late, a car pulled into the car park and flashed its headlights. Wade got out of her car slowly. She kept her handbag slung over her shoulder, her hand inside gripping the butt of her pistol tightly.

She crossed the car park, her high heels clicking on the tarmac. The other car kept its high beams on, deliberately dazzling her, so that the person who got out to meet her was nothing more than a silhouette until he was right in front of her.

""Miss Wade?"" the man asked. He was a small man, portly, and he had a curious smell about him. He was wearing overalls and heavy coat, a combination which was making him sweat heavily, further adding to his smell.

""Ms."" replied Wade. ""And you're late. Have you got it?""

The man smiling solicitously. ""Yes, I have it. If you have my fee, that is ...""

Wade reached into her handbag with her off-hand, never releasing her grip on her pistol. She pulled out a light brown envelope, stuffed with money. The portly man's eyes bulged greedily, as if he could spend the money simply by looking at it hard enough.

""Goods first, then payment,"" said Wade, sternly.

""Of course,"" replied the portly man. He waddled off the boot of his car and returned a few moments later with a large shoe box. There were air holes punched in the top, and something scrabbled around inside.

""What the hell's that?"" asked Wade. ""If you're trying to screw me then I'll ...""

""Ms. Wade, Ms. Wade,"" cooed the portly man, ""Let me explain.""

He opened the lid of the box, and Wade peered inside. A scrawny, ragged looking animal looked back at her, and hissed its obvious displeasure. The portly man jammed the lid of the box shut before the creature could escape.

""I'll say it again,"" Wade growled, ""What ... the hell ... is that?""

""It's a shrew,"" replied the portly man. ""It's a type of ...""

""I know what a shrew is,"" interrupted Wade. ""What I want to know is why you've brought me that, when I clearly asked you to bring me a soul.""

""Ah well,"" the portly man began to explain, ""The problem was, the soul that you wanted, well ... it had already been reincarnated. I did try to warn you when you asked me to track him down, he'd been dead for quite a while and you did say that he'd turned to Buddhism towards the end of his life. I think they get some kind of express pass, or something.""

Wade peered at the box suspiciously.

""So, that's him, in there. He's a shrew now.""

""Yes, precisely.""

""You're sure?"" Wade almost couldn't believe she was asking the question. Whatever grasp she thought she had had on the world was quickly crumbling.

""Of course I'm sure. Trust me, when you get a good look at him, you can see it in his eyes.""

Wade chewed her lip, mulling the situation over. ""So, what do I do with him?"" she asked.

""Well, it's a bit more complex than what we've been doing so far,"" replied the portly man. ""Recently deceased souls, drifting around, they're only too happy to jump back into a body for a bit. This fellow on the other hand, well ... he seems to quite like being a shrew. I'm afraid you're going to have to do something a little drastic.""

Wade waited. If there was one thing that was true no matter what side of the line of sanity you were on, it was that some people liked to talk. The portly man was one of them, and Wade knew how to listen.

""You're going to have to commit ... shrewicide,"" he said finally, and waited for Wade to laugh.

""I kill it?"" she asked, her voice deadpan.

The portly man looked crest fallen. ""Yes, basically. Kill the shrew, drink the blood, and wait. He won't be able to help himself, Buddhist or not, he'll get sucked straight into you.""

""And the memories, everything he knows?""

""Same as always, yours for the taking until he shakes himself loose.""

Wade tossed the envelope of money onto the bonnet of the car.

""This had better work,"" she said, taking the shoe box from the portly man. ""If I end up with a dead shrew and no story ...""

""Have I ever let you down?"" the portly man said, hastily counting his money before shoving the envelope in his pocket.

""Fair enough,"" replied Wade. ""Until next time.""

In his box, the shrew who was once a man skittered around.

""And you, my friend,"" whispered Wade as she walked back to her car. ""Get ready to give up all your little secrets. Tomorrow, you're going to be back on the front page.""

The bomber dipped, breaking through the clouds. They lit of amber, orange, and red, illuminated by the fires and explosions from the battle below. Searchlights stabbed up into the night sky, but the bomber flew through them invisibly, thanks to Cecil's carefully painted runes and sigils on the great metal beast's underbelly.

Kirk stood at the back doors, letting the wind jerk him this way and that. Bursting shells sent waves of pressure at him, buffeting the bomber even through the protective charms that had been cast on it before take off.

""Can you hear them?"" asked Cecil. The warlock felt no need to announce himself. Even in the middle of a full scale war, he had no doubt that Kirk had heard him coming. ""Can you hear the humans?""

""Yeah, I hear them,"" replied Kirk. ""Smell them too.""

Clinging onto a safety strap, Cecil edged gingerly to the open back doors of the bomber.

""You sure you want to be back here?"" asked Kirk. ""You can't fly without your pitchfork, Cecil.""

""And you can't fly at all,"" replied the warlock bitterly.

""Don't need to fly,"" said Kirk, stepping confidently to the very edge of the doors, he feet hanging over the lip into empty space. ""I land on my feet.""

""That's cats.""

""Whatever,"" said Kirk dismissively. ""You'll see soon enough.""

The bomber dropped suddenly, sending Cecil scrambling back along the length of the safety harness.

""I'll be glad when this over,"" Kirk said, raising his voice over the bomber's now straining engines and the growing howl of the wind. ""We can all go back to our rightful places.""

Cecil smiled, a little queasily. ""That would be ... nice.""

In the roof of the bomber, a large green light flared.

""That's my queue,"" said Kirk, and turned back towards the open doors.

""It's the right thing you know,"" shouted Cecil over the din of the bomber and the battle below, ""It's the right thing, what you're doing. The humans, they're just not ready, and if they keep digging ...""

""I know,"" Kirk called back, tightening the shoulder straps on his uniform. ""And even if I didn't, I won't remember a thing tomorrow. Just a little hangover and a few bruises. Nothing a clean uniform and a hot shower won't fix.""

Cecil knew he was lying. It was one of the things that a Warlock could always tell.

""Then I'll see you in Berlin!"" shouted Cecil.

Kirk raised a hand, a movement as close to a salute as he was ever likely to give anyone, and stepped out of the plane. Cecil listened intently, and smiled as Kirk's own howl grew loud enough to drown out the engines, the battle, even the artillery.

For some jobs, only a wolfman would do."

She was a kid, a girl, someone's baby. Not a dame, or a broad, or a skirt. And not the kind of girl you expected to see this side of town, where the wild things were.

But there she was. There she was with her blond hair dyed orange by dried blood. There her teeth where, smashed and scattered around like a broken daisy chain. There she lay, dead and bloody and blond and still someone's kid, even if right now nobody cared.

""Another one,"" grumbled the beat cop, the dead girl at his feet as inconvenient to him as a cold cup of coffee. ""Whoever this guy is, he's racking 'em up alright. What was she, prostitute?""

The detective squatted down next to the body, flicking the dead girl's hair back with the end of a well chewed pen.

""Don't recognise her,"" he said, impassively. ""I'll ask the boys in vice, see if they know her.""

""Hah, yeah. Maybe one of them was a regular, eh?"" joked the cop. He pulled a boiled sweet from his pocket and unwrapped it noisily. ""Always fancied vice myself, you know? From what I've heard ...""

""I wouldn't know,"" said the detective, interrupting the cop. Watching from the alleyway opposite, Harry smiled. Maybe there were still a few good police in the city. Not that having a good heart gave you a good head, but it was a start if nothing else. Harry continued to watch as the detective poked and prodded, made notes with his well chewed pen in a dog-eared notepad, and ignored the cop's attempts to engage him a conversation about the relative ""perks"" of working in vice.

Harry heard the rain drum its wet fingertips on the brim of his top hat before he felt it.

""Cover her up,"" said the detective. ""Looks like the forensics boys are going to be a while.""

The cop took of his uniform jacket, grumbling, and tossed it carelessly across the girl. It covered her body and head, leaving her pale, bare legs exposed to the rain. The rainwater ran underneath her body, and brought tiny rivulets of diluted blood trickling down her thighs. ""I suppose you expect me to just stand here in me shirtsleeves then?"" asked the cop, sarcastically. ""I'll catch my bloody death.""

""I'll wait, you knock off for the night. Sight like this, I'm sure you need some time to get over it, right?"" It was a clumsy gambit, but the cop wasn't the type to pick up on subtlety. A hint needed to hit him square between the eyes.

""Yeah, yeah,"" the cop replied, crunching the sweet as if it had the idea in its centre. ""I should probably, you know, get some help ... or something. See someone, you know, about the stress?""

""Post ... traumatic ... stress ... disorder,"" the detective said, slowly enough that even the cop's brain could record the words. ""Friend of mine found a dead hobo in a bin once, folded up like a five pound note. Got six grand compensation, cushy desk job when he got back too. Rest of the guys spent the next six months checking every bin they passed.""

The cop nodded slowly. ""Yeah ... yeah.""

The detective looked at him, raising an eyebrow. He all but nudged him. Harry stifled a chuckle. Some people had so little imagination. 

""So, I should probably go then,"" said the cop. The final safety checks. This was happening. The detective was sending him on his way, no questions asked. Take a break. Have a freebie. Top up the pension fund with a little handout from the city. You've had a bad day.

The detective didn't answer, just grunted and squatted back down over the dead girl. The only other witness to this tiny crime of corruption, she wasn't going to say anything. Harry watched as the cop slunk away, his pace quickening as he put some distance between him, the detective, and the dead girl that was his ticket to a fat payout and a cushy desk job. He got in his car, fired up the engine, and raced off into the wet night.

Harry waited until he was around the corner and out of sight before crossing the road. He tipped his top hat to the detective in greeting.

""You took your time,"" complained the detective.

""Been watching,"" replied Harry. ""Watching you play shove haypenny with our friends slow brain. What a regrettably small brain he must have, rattled around in that cavernous head.""

The detective snapped his fingers. It was hard to keep Harry on topic. His mind wandered like litter in the breeze. ""And speaking of heads?""

Harry looked down as the detective pulled the cop's raid sodden coat back from the girl's body. Her head had rolled to one side, a glassy eye staring up into the rain. Harry ran his eyes across the gap between head and body, the tattered edges of the neck curling in the rain.

""Oh yes, yes, that's his work. Cut cut, snap, snap. The Queen has been here with her chief chopper of heads.""

The detective rubbed his eyes. 

""I guessed that much,"" he said. ""We've managed to keep this out of the papers for now, so a copycat isn't likely. Not yet, anyway.""

""I knew a cat once,"" replied Harry. ""If this is him and not the Queen, you'll never catch him.""

""No, I mean a copycat. Someone copying what the Queen is doing.""

""Oh, she wouldn't stand for that.""

The detective looked at Harry. Mad Harry, Harry the Hatter. At first he hadn't believed that he was real, hadn't believed any of it was real."

Chem hadn't seen a human for almost forty years, the day he came across the girl. He found her scavenging on the edge of the farm, digging for roots and grubs. She was using her hands, the humans had not reinvented tools yet, and it was her yelp as her fingers struck a hidden rock that alerted him. Chem's hearing was acute enough to hear the petals of the plants in his garden unfold in the early morning sun, and the scream of a human was deafening by comparison.

Chem wondered if she knew what he was. Clearly, he was not an animal of any type. And plants, even in this new strange world that had grown from the corpse of the last, did not walk about on two legs. He thought perhaps that the human girl saw him for what he was; a slab of rock and clay, formed in a mould in a factory, and imbued with alchemical life my a process that had once been mystical, but that had become the property of scientists and industrialists. They hadn't liked the word ""Golum"", it wasn't marketable. But that was what he was.

The girl had looked up at him, blonde hair matted with dirt and covering half her face, squinting in the sunlight, and held out her bloody hand. Chem had suspected that there were still humans, hiding underground. This was a young one, probably unschooled in their ways of evasion and cunning.

Chem's own hand, eight fingered and two thumbed, dwarfed the girl's as he reached down to her and crushed her head like a piece of overripe fruit. Blood and brains squired out from between his digits, splattering on the ground. The plants in the garden, despite their lack of legs, sensed the blood and shuffled anxiously.

""Always hungry,"" said Chem, his voice a landslide of gravel, and smiled at his charges. He would have to hunt the other humans down, but for now there was the garden, and there was still so much work to do. It barely covered the continent, after all.

Whoever had replaced the golum's instructions with the words ""Save the Earth"" clearly had no idea how big a job it really was."

The Synder Brothers weren't smart people, but they were smart enough to know that when you got into trouble ... when you got into real trouble ... you went to see Cassius. And they were smart enough to know that they were in real trouble.

""You knock,"" said Ray, the older brother and, by right of birth, the leader of this band of two.

""You knock,"" replied George, the younger brother and, by lack of right of birth, the follower and the one carrying the blood soaked mass, bundled up in dirty sheets, that was the very trouble that the Synders needed Cassius to fix.

Ray shrugged and thumped on the door with his fist. His knuckles were bloody, just like the sheets, and left dark brown patches on the rough wood of the door. ""He'd better be in.""

The door swung open soundlessly. ""He's in,"" said Cassius, his voice like honey and poison at the same time. The Synders didn't believe for a minute in all the voodoo bullshit that Cassius surrounded himself with, but even they had to admit that he had style. ""Come on in, you're late.""

Ray and George stepped warily into Cassius' small shack. Cassius had the place done out to fool the tourists, a mess of skulls and candles and feathers, all the trappings a rube would expect of the Voodoo man, but it wasn't that that made Ray and George uneasy. No, ignoring the voodoo stuff was one thing, but ignoring Cassius' price was another. And there was always a price for Cassius' help.

That was why people only came here when they were in real trouble.

""Put it down, man, and rest yourself,"" said Cassius, pulling an old chair out from underneath a small table. George looked at his brother warily, waiting for the nod that meant it was OK to do as he was being told. Ray nodded, and pulled out a chair for himself. Dealing with Cassius was like dealing with a cornered snake; you didn't make any sudden moves, and you kept your eyes on where his eyes were looking.

George stooped and dropped the bundle onto the floor. A small bare leg and pudgy foot popped out, and a small pink shoe bounced loose.

""Fuck's sake, George!"" spat Ray, snatching up the shoe and shoving it, and the leg, back inside the mound of bloody sheets. When he turned back to the table, Cassius was smiling, his yellow and black teeth a billboard that announced ""YOU'RE FUCKED"" to anyone who saw them.

""Guess I don't need to ask what it is that you boys need then, huh?"" he said, pulling a bent joint from a pocket in his waistcoat and lighting it from a candle.

""It was an accident,"" said Ray, ""George, he ...""

Cassius held up his hands and blew out a plume of blue smoke that coiled like a viper in the air. ""Brother, Cassius isn't here to judge you. I'm just here to help.""

""For a price,"" said Ray.

""For a price,"" replied Cassius.

Ray reached into the pocket of his jeans and pulled our a roll of dirty notes. There was blood on these as well, but it wasn't Ray's.

""This is all we've got,"" said Ray, tossing the money onto the table.

Cassius raised an eyebrow, looking at the money curiously. ""Funny thing is, I usually set the price, not the other way 'round.""

Ray swallowed. He'd gripped the snake now, and it looked like he had the end that bit. He looked at his brother, sitting cross-legged on the floor next to the pile of sheets that could send them both to prison, or the chair. It was all the kid could do not to break down in tears.

""I can get more,"" said Ray. ""But I'll need more time. I'm good for the rest Cassius, I swear it, but we need help now. George he ... he can't go to prison.""

Cassius blew out another plume of smoke, another snake in the air that writhed past Ray, stinging his eyes.

""I don't wanna hear it, brother,"" said the voodoo man. ""Accessory after the fact, and all that, yeah? You tell me what happened, I got to keep that shit secret if the cops coming knocking. Right now, I'm just a guy, you're just a guy, and you want a favour. That's it.""

""Yeah, yeah,"" Ray croaked, relief robbing him of his voice for a moment. ""Just guys. I won't let you down, Cassius.""

Ray held out his hand, and it hung in the air limply as Cassius picked up the money from the table and shoved it inside his waistcoat. ""Follow me boys,"" he said, picking his way across the small shack between the cramped furniture and voodoo paraphenalia, carefully avoiding the mound of bloody sheets in the middle of the floor. ""Let's go meet Sobek.""

Leaving the shack through the back door, Ray and George carried the bundle between them. It was only yards from Cassius' back door to the edge of the swamp, and the ground was wet and treacherous underfoot. Cassius led the way, the glowing tip of his joint the only light other than the fat amber moon that lurked behind the clouds overhead.

""Ignore the sign,"" said Cassisu with a chuckle, as the strange trio passed a sign admonishing passer's by for ""Feeding or Molesting"" the alligators. ""Although, I guess you two have already done all your molesting for the day, huh?""

Ray didn't answer. If there was anywhere where Cassius was most dangerous, it was here, disappearing into the fertile green and brown world of the swamp. He'd heard a rumour once that Cassius had a family living in the swamp, somewhere.

They reached the edge of a small glade, where the ground gave way to dark, murky waters. Strange swamp things moved under the surface, scattering as Cassius crouched down and dipped his finger into the water. He swirled this way and that, making patterns that caused the water to move in strange ways.

""Look away, George,"" said Ray to his brother. ""Close your eyes.""

In the darkness of the water, something gleamed, and Ray got the impression that something was swimming up towards them from a depth far deeper than the swallow pool should have had. The water began to foam and swirl, is if it was going to drain suddenly away. Cassius smiled, his ""FUCK YOU"" grin, and yanked his finger out of the water as a pair of monsterous green and black jaws burst forth, snapping at the air with jagged teeth.

With a crash, Sobek landed on the ground, snarling and hissing. Ray had never seen anything like it. bigger than any 'gator or croc' he'd even seen, the creature was the size of five or six men. The ground sank underneath the creature's broad, horned feet and its thick tail disappeared back into the water behind it. The jaws, longer than a man's arm and leg together, grew still as Cassius lay his hand gently on the creature's nose and whispered to it in whatever strange tongue voodoo men speak to such creatures in. Ray couldn't understand it, could barely hear it, but the part of his brain that he had inherited from some long dead lizard insisted that there were words.

""Sobek accepts your offering,"" Cassius said, ""Place it here.""

Ray took the full weight of the bundle from George and lay it down in front of the gargantuan Sobek. Behind him, George whimpered like a child. Ray could smell piss and watched as a dark patch spread on the front of his brother's jeans. Sobek's nose dipped to the bundle, and snuffled at it.

Ray closed his eyes as the creature opened its massive jaws to slowly engulf the bundle. The sheets, the blood, the tiny leg, the shoe, and everything else that had remained mercifully hidden from view disappeared into the dark gulf of Sobek's jaws. He kept his eyes tight shut through the noises that came next; snapping, crunching, popping, ripping. Sobek gobbled and chewed and swallowed down the Snyder Brother's dirty little secret in mere moments.

""It's over,"" said Cassius, and Ray opened his eyes. The creature, Sobek, was gone ... and so was George.

""There's no evidence that will come back to you,"" said Cassius. ""That's how it works. What Sobek eats is gone from the world as if it were never there. The girl's parents won't look for her, and even George will fade from your memory in time.""

""That's ... good,"" said Ray. A numbness had crept over him. He wondered if it were simple shock, or whether this was what it felt like when Sobek's teeth nibbled pieces out of your memory. ""He ... he didn't scream ...""

Cassius wrapped his arm around Ray and began to steer him away from the glade, back out of the swamp and away from the place where his brother had stood for the last time. ""My gift to you,"" said Cassius, ""As a guy, to another guy, just doing a favour. It's better that way. Otherwise, the screaming is the only thing you can remember, and you'll never know why.""

Aquamarine landed silently on the leaf next to her father, her wings beating softly in the warm summer air. She loved flying on a night like this, when the heat that had baked the ground during the day was released in wave upon wave of warmth. It was the whole world breathing out, lifting her on its breath.

But that was the way that Aquamarine saw things, and her father considered her a frivalous creature.

""Father?""

Aquamarine's father did not turn his eyes away from the battlefield. ""Captain,"" he replied flatly. He would only ever address her by her rank here on the field of battle. She would have traded every breath the world had just to hear him call her by her own name again.

""How goes it?""

Aquamarine's father lowered his viewing glass. He looked weary, and his wings were drooping and gray.

""The grass continues its onslaught against the tree's territory. The earthworms have broken through the northern sea shell barrier, there are slugs on the march ...""

Aquamarine grabbed her father instinctively as he stumbled forward, his legs suddenly to weak to support him. His wings had turned a deeper gray, with barely a trace of their original bold red to be seen.

""When did you last sleep father?""

""I will sleep when the garden is secure, when our people are safe.""

Gently lowering her father down, Aquamarine rested beside him on the leaf. Beneath them, the sounds of the garden raged. The leaf trembled, and Aquamarine's wings fluttered instinctively.

""Fly,"" her father gasped. ""Fly while you still can.""

""Shhh, there's plenty of time. I'm only at my third moon.""

""This war has run for more than a hundred moons, child. My father fought, his father, his father before that. What are we fighting for, if not the freedom to fly?""

Aquamarine smiled. ""Sometimes, father, I think you fight because you like it.""

""Hah,"" the old man laughed. His wings flared with colour for a moment, an explosion of red and crimsons. Blood colours. Soldier's colours. He struggled to his feet. ""I suppose I might have one or two more moons in me yet, Captain.""

""Sir,"" replied Aquamarine, and snapped off a clumsy salute before taking once more to the skies. The warm air bouyed her up over the field of battle and she thought, just for a moment, that she her father take his eyes away from the war that raged all around them to watch his daughter fly.

It was a war worth winning, she agreed. It was a war for the freedom to fly."

It has been a long hiatus.

My amazing wife and I had twins (had being an odd word to use, as we still have them now) and I mistakenly thought writing would continue as usual. I also changed job, becoming CTO of a very exciting new business called <a title=""eCommerce Centric"" href=""http://www.ecommercecentric.co.uk"">eCommerce Centric</a>. And then we moved house.

Life, as they say, happened.

So, tonight I did a something that I have not done in a very long time - I wrote a short script, and sent it off to an anthology to see if I can somehow worm my way into their pages. I have the butterflies back, those little editorial butterflies that swim around inside you and ask if you did enough proof reading. I've missed them, in all their fluttery glory.

I'm also posting to the blog for the first time in a very long time.

Hello. I'm back. Glad you are still here.

Since my <a href=""http://www.ecommercecentric.co.uk/blog/2012-10-15.Changes_to_Adwords_Policy_and_What_You_Should_Do_Today"">last blog on Google Adwords policy</a>, I've been digging deeper into the Adwords strategies of some Tier 1 retailers to see who is following the rules, and who isn't.

In my latest blog post for eCommerce Centric ""<a href=""http://www.ecommercecentric.co.uk/blog/2012-10-16.Adwords_Part_Two_-_Making_Landing_Pages_Relevant"">Making Landing Pages Relevant for Google Adwords</a>"", I've explored the very real problem of ""bait and switch"" adverts - adverts that say one thing, then deliver another. I have been staggered by how many major retailers (<em>Disclaimer: None of which are clients) </em>don't seem to have a handle on their Adwords campaigns. What has started to really frustrate me is that I am starting to see these poorly configured adverts not as just a waste of money by the people paying for them, but as a disservice to me as a customer and consumer.

Google <strong>do</strong> have somewhere that you can <a href=""http://support.google.com/adwords/bin/request.py?contact_type=feedback"">report adverts that violate Google Adwords policies</a>, which would now include ads that don't take you to the products they were advertising, but it is buried three or four clicks deep in their support pages. It makes you wonder if Google really care when consumers are misdirected, or if their real reward is in users hitting ""back"" and moving on to the next advert.

Of course, as I point out in my blog, Google are in the business of <strong>relevant search results.</strong> Of course they care if poor adverts start to cost them market share, or make people less likely to trust adwords, but I think the ""penalty"" for violation won't show itself as adverts being blocked and accounts being shut. It is far more likely, I think, that Google will hit violators in the pocket with higher costs per click.

All of which, ultimately, is good for the little guy who plays by the rules ... <em>eventually.</em>"

A Cynic's View Of The New Google Disavow Tool#
Google recently announced its new ""Disavow Tool"", allowing webmasters to disavow ""bad links"" to their websites.

Amidst all the excitement from SEO types and the sudden surge in articles telling us all how best to use this new tool (no two articles really agreeing, of course), two points for the cynics amongst us seemed to remain unexplored. Following on from <a href=""http://www.seomoz.org/blog/googles-disavow-tool-take-a-deep-breath#jtc198031"">my post to the SEOMoz forums</a>, I wanted to put down here some of my thoughts on the addition of the tool and what it might <em>really</em> mean for Google, its algorithm, and ""negative SEO"".

My theory is laid out chronlogically below, with the evolution of SEO being crucial to understanding why I think this tool now exists:
<blockquote>1: ""Everyone knows"" that Google values links. Link building becomes king and we all spend lots of time trying to build good links. Professional link building begins.

2: Someone figures out that you don't need to do it like that, you can just sell links between sites. Link buying is born.

3: Link Buying becomes a commodity product, as some of it can be automated and what can be automated can be done en-mass by low skilled workers. Sweat shops link farms are born, and we all get the change to buy ""100 PR9+ Links for $99"".

4: Google start to see the importance of linkage slipping and need to try and stop these dirty tricksters. But, heck, those tricksters and sneaky and do lots of clever things to hide their link farms and pass their battery-farmed link eggs off as good, wholesome, organic eggs.

5: Google need a way to tell which links are good and which links are bad, but that's very difficult and people keep complaining about algorithm updates that don't do what we think they should. If only there was a way they could persuade us to 'fess-up our link building sins...

6: So... Google tell us all that link farms are bad and that if we don't stop using them then the SERP Boogie Man is going to come and kill us in our beds. And penalise our sites, which is worse.

7: Panic begins. ""What is someone does it to me?"" we cry. ""Negative SEO? What's that? Can it be true?""

7: Google say ""Don't Panic"" and give us a tool to ""disavow"" those naughty links. The ones that they can't find that easily.

8: Everyone jumps on and shops any naughty links. Sweat is wiped from brows and everyone gets to tell their SEO clients that their nose is well and truly clean.

9: Google site back and collate a big, fat database of confessions from webmasters, then launch their algorithm nukes at the worst offending link farms.</blockquote>
So, am I a cynic or is this as obvious to everyone else as it is to me? Could this be the start of Google moving towards human-editing to help control its index? Or is it just the death of those adverts that off 100 PR9+ links for $99?

Mashable are featuring a great Op-Ed piece today ""<a href=""http://mashable.com/2012/10/23/ipad-3-owner-oped/"">IPad 3 Owner Burned</a>"".

The article talks about the consumer's feeling of being ""burned"" as Apple announce the iPad 4 just 7 months after the release of the iPad 3. The new model will have <em></em><em> significantly</em> higher specifications, and the resale value of existing iPad3 is crashing as a result.

As the article points out, this problem really only affects the specific type of user who early-adopts Apple products and who is ready and willing to queue in line for the ""next best model"". It also points out that Apples timeline between hardware updates is getting shorter and shorter. Whilst the iPhone release has become an almost annual event, mostly I suspect to tie in with expiration of mobile phone contracts, the iPad release schedule is gaining speed.

<em><strong>So, why are Apple releasing hardware updates faster and faster?</strong></em>

Personally. I think the answer lies in the arms race that Apple now find themselves in against every Android vendor our there. Not so much the unknown brands turning out Android powered tablet devices for the budget concious, but the likes of Samsung, Google, and Amazon.

The iPad Mini launch has already given us all the opportunity to compare the specs of the new iPad Mini to our favourite Android devices, and the results look good for Android. Just check out this article from Android Headlines to see<a href=""http://androidheadlines.com/2012/10/featured-how-does-the-apple-ipad-mini-compare-to-the-google-nexus-7.html""> how far behind the spec of the Nexus 7 the iPad Mini is</a> <em>already. </em>Remember, Google are already working on their next version of this device.

Apple stole the march on pretty much an entire industry, arguably <em></em><em> creating</em> a new industry, with the launch of the iPad. Now they need to keep up with everyone else, and keeping up may mean releasing new hardware every time a competitor does.

The speed of updates looks like it can only increase, and the risk of burning out loyal customers is now very real."

Dorothy had been walking for three hours in the rain. Her dress was wet through, and the tiny coat that she had thrown over her shoulders as a concession to the weather was little more than a sopping rag.

There was no moon overhead, and the noises of the city had long since died.  Everything, it seemed, had died.

All there was was Dorothy, the rain, and the flickering street lights. Two ahead, one behind. Always that, two ahead and one behind. Dorothy didn't know how she knew it, but she knew that she had to stay in the light. The light was safety.

All she had to do was stay in the light.

The light behind Dorothy flickered, and she instinctively skipped two steps forward, cross thorough the point where the light overlapped best. The light behind died a moment later, and a new one sprang up in its place, ahead of Dorothy.

Two ahead, one behind.

Dorothy wished she had listened to her mother and stayed in tonight. She wished she'd shared a cab with her friends, instead of deciding to walk home. She wished that she knew where she was right now, that she could catch some glimpse of the world beyond her little patch of light. She wished the growling would stop, whatever it was. It didn't seem to move, didn't seem to change with the lights. Whatever it was seemed to be right next to her, and yet there was nothing there.

Just the lights, blinking and flickering. Moving her onwards.

Two ahead, one behind.

<hr />

""Can you hear me love?""

The paramedics huddled over Dorothy, trying to keep the rain off her crumpled body. The engine of the car that hit her was still running, coughing and growling, one of its headlights casting a stark halogen over the bloody scene.

""No pupil response...""  said one of them, flashing a small torch across Dorothy's eyes as he held them open.

""Go again"" said the other, ""She's still with us...""

""Until they move this car,"" replied the first. ""And then that's it.""

""Well, maybe she'll get where she's going,"" said the other, ""Sometimes they do.""

""Sometimes""

<hr>

And in the dark, Dorothy dodged through the lights again, the rumbling growl never leaving her side."

It had started in the West. And that was fair enough, because that was what everyone said the West was all about. America, the land of opportunity. The land of fresh starts. The place where anything could happen.

And it did.

It had started when Jacob had rode into the wrong town with his little family on the cart behind him. He wasn't much of a map reader but, swept up in the gold rush and eager to stake his claim, he'd loaded them all onto a small cart and headed West. He had hoped to hitch up to one of the big wagon trains, then break away from them when the time was right. Find a good spot, near a good town. Somewhere for the kids to get schooled, so they wouldn't end up chasing dreams across the country like their old man, somewhere for his wife to buy fine dresses with all the money his claim would earn them. Church on a Sunday, singing praises to high heaven, a good respectable man with a good respectable family.

But Jacob didn't find his wagon train. He didn't find the perfect little town he'd dreamed of. He found a place called Malady, and it was fair to say that the place found him.

Did it matter now? Maybe, maybe not. The town was gone. But Jacob was still wandering, and every town he blew into was another town just like Malady. A town just like the town that took his family.

""Jay? Are you coming down for breakfast?""

A woman's voice shook Jacob lose of his memories and back into the present day. The very present day. The calendar on the wall said the year as 2012. A long way from the days of the West, and a long way from Malady. 

""Sure, I'll ... er ... be right down.""

Jacob checked his profile in the mirror. This body was fifteen or sixteen, he'd wager. A man, where Jacob came from, but little more than a child in this time. The six shooter was snug in the back of his denims, the loose shirt he was wearing giving it no outline. The six shooter was always there, wherever and whenever Jacob woke up. It was the constant, the steady point around which his world turned.

The gun was love.

Downstairs, a woman who Jacob guessed was his mother made pancakes. The food here sure beat a lot of the places he'd woken up, but a full belly didn't make the world right. It just ... slowed men down. Contentment was not a state of mind that Jacob could allow himself. Even as he ate the pancakes, feeling their warmth dull his hunger, his eyes picked apart the woman in front of him and found the monster underneath. She was the same, no better than any of the others. Her painted face, her clothes. Another one, like all the rest.

Jacob at the last mouthful of pancake and pulled the six shooter out from behind his back.

""This gun is love,"" he said, and shot his mother through the head."

If you are reading this, you are looking at the **all new Planet of the Penguins**.

It has an all new *""design""* (if you can call my minimal approach to typography and colour a design) but, more importantly, an all new CMS.

The CMS powering this website is the [engine4](http://www.engine4.net) CMS pattern, a ""bare bones"" CMS that I built to illustrate how you build a CMS using engine4. I hope that by using this CMS as *my* day-to-day CMS I will find all the kinks, issues, bugs, and problems not only in the CMS pattern but also in the framework itself. I'm a big advocate of the [""dog fooding""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) process, so I've laid myself up a big meal right here.

The other important new thing is that there will be **new content**. One of my big objections to Wordpress, and the major reason that I have stripped it out of my website, is that I felt it got in my way. I am a relentless and unashamed ""tweaker""; I like to play with how my website works and what it looks like just as much as I like to write content for it. Wordpress didn't make this easier for me. If anything, the fact that I couldn't get the result that I wanted meant that I sacrificed to tweaking Wordpress when I should have/could have been writing.

So, if this is the only post on this blog then the experiment has failed. The engine4 CMS pattern has eaten up all my spare time and I have not written one jot. If, however, this post has vanished down into the bowels of the site, then things are working.

I'll be blogging here about every step of each process - my quest to create a perfect writer's CMS, my quest to write and publish more this year than ever before, and the curious intersection between technology, creativity, writing, and productivity that seems to be my ""beat"".

See you next time. Assuming there is one...

There are lots of [cheap Android Tablets](http://www.technologycentric.co.uk) out there. What always surprises me is that people only think of them as tablets, in particular getting hung up on the comparison between their particular Android tablet and the latest iPad. For me, this isn't the point.

What a cheap Android Tablet represents to me is a light, portable computing device with expandable storage and a built in touch screen display. Look at them *that* way, and what you can do with these things is almost endless.

So, today's experiment - can I turn a regular TV into a smart TV equivalent?

## What is a ""Smart TV""?

For the purposes of this experiment, a Smart TV is a TV that can access the internet and play internet-based content. Our smart TV is also going to be social; keeping us up to date with email, Twitter, and Facebook.

## What do I need?

There isn't much you need to complete this one:

1. An Android Tablet with WiFi, Bluetooth, and HDMI output.
2. A TV with HDMI input
3. A HDMI lead
4. A mobile phone

## Step One. Prep the tablet.

Most Android tablets will have the majority of apps you need preinstallled. Check that the following are available and up to date:

1. Chrome
1. YouTube
1. Your Twitter Client of choice (right now I use *Twicca*)
1. Facebook

If you use any paid-for stream services, such as Netflix or Spotify, make sure these are installed and configured as well.

## Step Two. Install Remote Control Software

The next step is to install the remote control software for your Android tablet and connect it to your mobile phone.

First, download [Tablet Remote](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tournesol.tabletremote&feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDNd) from Google Play to **both** your Android Tablet and your smartphone.

Run the software on both devices, following the configuration steps to configure and activate the new keyboard.

When the virtual keyboard is configured for both devices, you are ready to connect the devices. Make sure both devices are connected to the same WiFi network and then:

1. On the tablet, go to the ""connection"" section and make the device visible over Bluetooth.
1. On the smartphone, go to the ""connection"" section and scan for devices.

Make the connection between the two devices and you should be able to use your mobile phone as a keyboard to control your Android tablet.

## Step Three: Connect to the TV

Making the TV connection is simple. Just plug the HDMI lead to both devices and switch your TV to the relevant input.

If you have any display issues, you will find settings to control the HDMI output in the Android Settings App.

I chose to conceal my tablet neatly around behind the TV, but you can leave it out on display if you so choose.

## Step Four: Enjoy!

That's it - you now have an Apple TV/Smart TV type environment that will keep you connected socially, allow you to browse the web, watch video, play music, etc."

Perhaps it is because I use Dropbox on both Windows and Linux, but there seems to be a problem with symlinks.

I like to use symlinks to re-use code libraries without having multiple copies on my machine. [Changing the PHP include path](http://php.net/manual/en/function.set-include-path.php) is another way to do this, but is less portable and doesn't cope with alternative versions as well. It is also ""hidden"" in the code, whereas a symlink is completely visible at directory/filesystem level.

However, if you symlink a directory from inside Dropbox then Dropbox seems to convert it to a copy of the real files at some point in the sychronisation process. This is different to Git, as an example, which can commit a symlink as a simple text file.

Just wondering if anyone else has had this same problem and if there is a workaround for it? In the short term, I have just moved my code out of Dropbox and over into my Github directory."

<img src=""fireman-mike-the-knight-be-a-do-it-right-305062.jpg"">

In the disturbing world of CBeedbies, Mike the Knight is normally safe territory. Mike decides to have a ""mission"", screws it up by being selfish, learns a moral lesson, and puts things right at the end. Every episode his sword, enchanted by his sister Evie the witch, turns into whatever he is going to need to solve his problems. (*As yet, it has not turned into the ability to remember a moral lesson from one episode to another - it seems to tap out at becoming something like a fishing rod*).

In today's episode, however, things took a grim turn.

Through a typically convoluted chain of events, Evie turned some of Mike's toy knights into living, breathing copies of Mike. 

At was at this point that my well-honed sci-fi/fantasy radar went off as if an Independence Day saucer has just appeared overhead.

Evie, who has previously been unable to get a simple sword +1 enhancement correct, can now create life. **LIFE**. I know it's a kid's show, but the internal logic of the show somewhat broke down for me then.

Of course, it all went wrong and the ersatz Mikes ran amok. Mr. Blacksmith and Mrs. Piecrust (catch up with the show True Believer) suffered yet again at the hands of Mike's tyranny. Somewhere in this show there is a deeply concealed critique of the feudal system, I'm sure.

So, having decided to ""Be a Knight, and Do it Right"", Mike got Evie to turn the living, breathing copies of himself back into soldiers.

I'm not saying he was *wrong*, one Mike the Knight is annoying enough, but that was a whole new **lifeform** right there. And now it is gone. If this was an episode of Star Trek TNG I can guarantee there would have been some *pretty heated discussion* in the Ready Room about that move. 

The moral, in the end, was to take responsibility for your own chores.

Personally, I think the moral should have been ""watch out for your sister, she wields god-like power"".

Just sayin' ...

A recent query from a friend about exporting/printing comics from Celtx in the ""traditional"" comic book format, as opposed to the mysterious tabular format that Celtx exports, got me to think about whether comics might not benefit from its own equivalent to [Foutain.io](http://www.fountain.io).

### What is Fountain.io?

For those not in the know, Fountain.io is a portable plain-text markup language from screen plays. Application and platform agnostic, it allows you to edit your screenplay on any device that can handle a plain-text file and then use software to format or convert it as you require.

With comic book scripts and screenplays sharing so many conventions, the parallels are obvious.

## The Proposed Format: ""Bubble""

I will script up a plain-text to formatted converter as soon as I can. In the meantime, these are the conventions I am considering.

**New Page**: Start the line with `#`

**Panel**: Start the line with `##`

**Character Name**: Indent by one tab.

**Dialogue or Dialogue Parenthetical**: Indent by two tabs

Any line that does not start with one of these reserved chunks will be treated as per the previous line we detected. This should allow for one of the things I find hardest to get Celtx to do - panel descriptions that include a paragraph/line-break.

When converted through the software, this markup would turn into the expected comic-book script layout. By using HTML & CSS output, users would be able to change the specific layout and formatting of the script without impacting the script itself.

I will post a sample as soon as I can."

<img src=""batman_braveandbold_mitefall_surfing.jpg"">

io9 are carrying a story with a rumoured cast list for the vaporware JLA movie. [http://io9.com/5978818/rumor-the--justice-league-movie-snubs-aquaman](http://io9.com/5978818/rumor-the--justice-league-movie-snubs-aquaman)

Surprise surprise, no AquaMan.

On a backdrop of ""AquaMan sucks"" vs. ""AquaMan does *not* suck debate"", there are however a few voices of reason. Trawling the comments and blog posts so that you don't have to, here are the **Top 5 Reasons AquaMan won't be in the JLA Movie**

### Nobody knows who he is (By nobody, I mean normal folks)

Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman all have established pop culture credentials. Green Lantern had a movie (honesty, he did. You can look it up). The Flash has enough iconic juice to carry him through, pretty much.

AquaMan... not so much. His most well known incarnation, in Batman The Brave and the Bold, is never going to fit in a big screen Hollywood movie. He's simply too **outrageous**.

### The movie probably won't take place out at sea

Avengers has set the template for the super hero showdown. You need a city, you need buildings to demolish, you need lots of innocents in peril. People live in cities, work in cities, shop in cities. The concept of a city being attacked and being in danger is understandable. 

If we aren't a ground level, the next most likely option is space. For those of you not in the know, space is **even further** away from the sea. 

### There is only so much screen time

The Avengers used a mix of characters who had already been introduced in their own movies or appeared in someone else's (Hawkeye is in the Thor - keep your eyes peeled True Believer). If the same model is followed for JLA, someone needs to put their money behind the **AquaMan Movie**.

OK, moving on...

### Orange is hard to CGI

I don't know if this is true, but if it is then that would be *just AquaMan's luck*

### AquaMan sucks

On a serious note, ""AquaMan Sucks"" is a big meme. Google it. Tumblrer it.

Somewhere in the hierarchy that will put this movie together, if indeed it ever gets put together, there are going to be people who don't know comics but do know money. And they probably also know how to Google and if they Google ""AquaMan"" then, King of Atlantis or no, they probably aren't going to like what they say.

It's the ""Inverse Snakes on a Plane"" rule, and you all made it true.

## How to Make AquaMan work in a JLA Movie

Disagree with this post? On a lot of levels, so do I. The reasoning above is based on a pretty cynical view of how I think this movie might be put together. Next post? My pitch for how AquaMan can not only fit into the JLA Movie, but **rule** it."

A few days ago I proposed a plain-text markup syntax for comic book scripts.

Since then I've been playing around with the format, writing some new scripts with it and converting some of my own scripts and some samples I had to hand into the language.

Fortunately for me there are already some great examples out there of how to do this sort of thing, so the syntax has come together quickly. Today I completed Version Zero of a PHP implementation of the code that [converts the plain text into comic book formatted script](pages/bubble), and have posted it up for people to try out today.

I've named the language [""Bubble""](pages/bubble), which is shorter than typing ""A Plain Text Markup Language for Comic Book Scripts"" over and over again. 

I'd really appreciate any feedback anyone can offer on the language and would love to hear from anyone who starts using it."

The response to the annoucement of Version 0.0 of Bubble was better than I ever expected, with great feedback and suggestions coming in from comic book writers who have already been putting the language to the test in the real world.

One of the features consistently asked for was **panel counts** - a function by which Bubble would update the page headings (PAGE 1, PAGE 2, etc.) with the number of panels in the page itself. 

I've added this to the Bubble code today, and am very happy to have version 0.1 ready for writers to try.

Eastenders bossing are re-casting the role of ""Bobby Beale"" so that the actor currently in the role can focus on his school work. 

Recastings in soap operas are not uncommon, and Eastenders is no exception. The Beale family are particularly prone to Galifrean regenerations; there have been four different Lucys, five Peters, and four Stephens. Arthur Fowler, Ian Beale's uncle, was once replaced for a whole episode by a bench.

What I do find mysterious is that the BBC have not taken advantage of this phenomenon sooner and made these transformations a part of the show.

This, I think, should be Bobby Beale's destiny. Imagine the ratings boost if...

## Bobby Beale uses the Chameleon Arch and becomes the Master

Eastenders needs a great villian, there's always a bit of argee-bargee on the square. What better way to ramp up the tension for Christmas episode than one of the Master's nefarious plans?

Actually there is [well documented history of crossing over between Easters and Dr Who](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/EastEnders) and [the Tardis has landed in Walford](http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2011/01/dwn180111180008-east-end-tardis.html) before. This could actually happen!

## Bobby Beale crosses over into an alternate dimension and is replaced by Bob-Ternate

Normal, amiable, Bobby is replaced by a sinister and malevolent version of himself, intent on taking ownership of The Queen Vic and the Fruit and Veg stall. We know which version of Bobby is being dropped off or picked up from school that day by Ian by the colour of the credits (they are already blue ... think about it)

## At the very least, Bobby's dad (not of entirely sound mind) notices the difference

Joking apart, I think this would be a fun nod towards the issue, although I doubt the Eastenders team want to make too much fun out of Ian's nervous breakdown. Having said that, there **was** a comedy hat ...

Should Bobby become Bob-ternate? **YOU DECIDE!**"

I am very pleased to be posting up so soon after the first release of Bubble that Version 0.3 is now online and available.

I am very much indebted to all the comics writers, artists, letters, and more who have left comments, Facebook posts, tweets, or emails for me with feedback on the project so far. Without this feedback, Version 0.3 would look very different.

## Get Started with Bubble 0.3

Just click the [Bubble Web Application](app/bubble) link to get started.

## What's New in Bubble 0.3

### New User Interface

First and foremost, the web interface to Bubble has been significantly upgraded. Rather than leaving the ""Dingus"" interface trapped in the main website theme, I am now using a much cleaner application-style theme to present the editor. The interface is based on the [Benevolent Dictator Application Theme](https://github.com/jwynia/BenevolentDictator).

Other than the plain text editor, the app now just has a clean header and a sidebar containing a quick reference for the Bubble Markup. Future versions will extend this interface to, hopefully, include file handling functions to push and pull scripts from online storage and local files.

### New output format

When formatting a piece of Bubble Markup, the output now pops up in its own window (or tab) for ease of printing, saving, or copy & pasting into your editor of choice.

### New Markup for Bold, Italic, and Underlining

As requested by a few of the brave users of Bubble Version 0.1, the markup now includes syntax for bold, italic, and underlining that can be used in dialogue and panel descriptions. The syntax for this replicates the syntax found in Markdown.

I hope you all enjoy using Version 0.3 and find the new features useful.

As always, any and all feedback is gratefully received."

RebelMouse is a web application that turns your social stream of Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and more into a Pinterest style grid of headlines and images, focussing on the posts that contain graphics and links.

Exceptionally easy to setup, the results really are impressive. I've yet to delve into the themeatic settings, configuration options, or post filtering and I'm already hooked. As well as pulling your own content through, you can also follow other users and follow specific hashtags.

In some ways the results are similar to paper.li, but more engaging from a design perspective and more personal to you.

<img src=""Selection_055.png"">

Best of all, there is a handy embed mode that allows you to put the RebelMouse grid inside your own website. I've added my RebelMouse feed to the right sidebar of this site. This is the real ""level up"" of RebelMouse - finally bringing an alternative to the turgid text-only lists of posts that adorn most websites and blogs today.

Bubble Version 0.5 is now live at [app/bubble](app/bubble). Many thanks to the people who have shared their own script formats with me to help improve Bubble and have given me their feedback. I am hoping to have multiple formats available by Version 1.0, so you will be able to choose your perfect format for converting your Bubble script and be able to change formats without changing your plain-text file.

Ah, such dreams!

In the meantime, here's ...

## What's New In Bubble 0.5

### Tabbed, rather than centered

A few people have pointed out that the center aligned formatting of the character names and dialogues didn't match any standard formats, so I have replaced this with a more ""tabbed"" approach.

### Less white space

Bubble is less wasteful with white space now, outputting fewer paragraph breaks to produce a tighter script.

### Control over uppercase and mixed case dialogue

For those who don't like all their characters shouting all the time, there is now an option to leave your dialogue in the case that you write it.

### Speech Bubble Numbering

As requested by several of the early adopters, Bubble now numbers your speech bubbles on a per-page basis.

### Public and Private Comments

To help with drafting, and replicate the ""notes"" functionality of more advanced editors, Bubble now has formats for public and private comments.

You can add a private comment, which will be excluded from the final formatted version but will appear in your plain-text, or you can create a shared comment that will appear in your formatted script. Both use a simple single character prefix, so it is easy to add, remove, and share comments.

<img src=""people-stocking-up-on-free-books-abandoned-by-amazon-second-hand-book-suppliers-feb-2009-bristol.jpg"">

Amazon have been issued a wide ranging patent on the resale of digital goods.

    Digital objects including e-books, audio, video, computer applications, etc., purchased from an original vendor by a user are stored in a user's personalized data store ... When the user no longer desires to retain the right to access the now-used digital content, the user may move the used digital content to another user's personalized data store when permissible and the used digital content is deleted from the originating user's personalized data store.

Whenever Amazon is issued a new patent, the traditional publishing industry traditionally gets out its pitchforks and burning torches and heads collectively towards the nearest castle to call for the head of Jeff Bezos. Taking time to consider this a bit though, are second hand eBooks really such a problem for anyone... least of all the people the publishers say that they want to protect - **writers**.

## Understanding the pricing model of second hand *anything*

All goods, be they first or second hand, are priced using a single and invariable formula of **how desirable the item is** and **how rare the item is**.

A second hand book is no different. Rare and desirable second hand books command a high price. Rare and undesirable second hand books command a lower price. Then we have desirable but readily available second hand books (I'm looking at *you*, Dan Brown), and then undesirable and plentiful second hand books (most celebrity autobiographies ever).

People seem to be massively concerned because eBooks, in their opinion, cannot be rare. This is true. It is impossible to run out of a digital commodity in the ""new"" state. However, until someone decides to sell their copy of (or license to) an eBook, **no** second hand eBooks exist. At all. Not a single one.

When a new eBook is released, it will therefore have scarcity guaranteed. No more second hand eBooks can ever be sold than were originally sold and the likelihood is that there will be fewer. Yes, if your book sells in the millions then there could, potentially, be hundreds of thousands of second hand copies available. Would you worry about that if they were *print* copies?

## Why are we afraid of second hand eBooks?

As a writer, I kind of like Amazon, and I like Kindle. I can publish there without a publisher, if I so choose, and my books are never out of print. The process is quick, the results can be immediate. The greatly reduced cost of logistics and production mean that there is more money available from an eBook sale to pay in royalties than on a print sale. When I self publish, I need a lot of sales just to **break even** on print. With digital, I am in profit from sale number 1 (Unless you count the time it takes to write books. If I took that into account I would shine shoes instead).

So, should I be any *more* afraid of people selling on my eBook than selling on a print eBook? Logically, I shouldn't be. When I sell a print copy of my book I relinquish all control of who looks at it, who they pass it on to, and what they do with it. The product belongs to *them*, not to me, at that point. It is a curious trick of our brains, I think, that makes us believe that we, in some way, retain some modicum of ownership over our digital products when we sell them. We have been so brain washed by the film and music industry that we believe that everyone out there wants to rip us off, pirate our material, and leave us penniless. Second hand eBooks don't make this any more or less likely. If people want to steal the content, they will. You will not, and cannot, stop them. The security will always be circumvented, the restrictions always evaded. In our paranoia to control digital products, we make them less palatable to consumers by stripping away one of the most fundamental rights there is - the right of **ownership**.

Ask the fundamental question - If I by an item, I own an item, why shouldn't I be able to a sell the item?

Those arguing against the ability to sell second hand digital goods argue that they are sold ""as new"" - they are immune to the ravages of time and of use. However, they are missing the fundamental point that this is a **good thing**. When we purchase second hand books today, the price of item also reflects the condition that it is in. Good condition = More desirable. Good condition and rare = Very much more desireable. Digital products are not immune to this equation, there is simply a constant in terms of the quality of the item. The digital book becomes no less desirable because it is second hand - the only factors affecting its value are therefore the fundamental desirability of the product (is this a good book or not?) and how many second hand copies there are available. Second hand eBooks should therefore retain greater value as compared to their physical equivalents, which suffer a precipitous drop in value the moment they become ""second hand"".

Second hand eBooks are fundamentally *not cheap* eBooks. They are just a secondary market of delayed release.

## How to make second hand eBooks work

Taking into account everything above, I think there is one very simple way to make eBooks works.

**When an eBook is sold second hand, ensure that the original publisher gets a royalty (acceptably a reduced one)**

In that **one** move, you could move the whole industry. 

Publishers have never had an income stream from second hand book sales. They have never had an income stream from books shared between friends or left on park benches. No publisher ever popped into a charity shop and started re-pricing the second hand books.

Second hand eBooks are not a threat to publishers. They are not a threat to creators. They are the digital world catching up to how things *should work* and they are a new revenue stream that only the most luddite of publishers would fail to recognise."

I began to draft a blog post called ""Thank you, Terry Deary"" today in response to the author's well reported attack on libraries. However, I have realised that someone already said it better.

For Mr. Terry Deary, here is Taylor Mali's incredible and inspiring ""I Will Fight You For the Library"".

<iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/2qXgPfMGG8E"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

And in case that makes it unclear, here is what I am saying...

Dear Mr. Terry Deary.

Thank you for reminding me what an immense priviledge it is to be a writer. Thank you for reminding me that everytime someone picks up one of my books or stories and reads it that they are giving me the greatest gift that any one human can give another - they are giving me their time, and their mind, to do with as I will. They are connecting with me and creating an exchange that has a value so far beyond monetary value, so vast in its scope, that it is easy to miss it entirely.

Thank you for reminding me that I do not write for the money, but I write because I love to write. Thank you for spurring me to write more, and to give more, simply to spite you.

And thank you for reminding me how important libraries are. As I wrote my original post I looked at photographs of my twin sons and came to the sudden realisation that if anyone had the gall to tell me that **they** could not read a book, could not have access to a book, simply because of money? Then would fight them for the library. I would fight them.

You are very quick to point out what you consider to be out-moded ideas, Mr. Deary. Perhaps you should consider that the most outmoded idea of all is that books and knowledge and information are the domain of the privledged and the affluent only and use the platform that your readers have given you to elevate them, not sabotage them.

Time to wake up, Mr. Deary. Your ideas are history (and a horrible one at that)."

It's an old adage but, before you next speak to your developer, try to imagine that you are talking to your plumber and that your toilet is leaking hellish amounts of human poo(1) all over your floor. If you wouldn't say it to your plumber, I would suggest that you don't want to say it to your developer either.

Still not sure? Here's my **Top 10 things not to say to a developer**.

1. It's only moving some stuff around
1. How can it take that long?
1. I can get a student to do this...
1. Can't you just copy and paste it from Amazon?
1. This is really urgent for us, we've tried to work around it but can't, so can you do it **now**
1. It's really simple
1. If you give me the code, I could probably do it myself
1. My son/daughter/nephew can do this in his/her bedroom
1. We really need this, but we don't want to pay for it

**1** Human poo is confirmed by [Wes Packer](http://www.wespacker.com/) as being the worst form of poo."

<img src=""e0c88029501f4712.jpg"">

Somewhat less glamourous than Ultrabook and tablets, but possessing a unique charm all of their own, netbooks continue to sell in large volumes. The Asus eeePC range remains particularly popular, especially among Linux users. With laptop screens getting bigger and bigger, but laps remaining stubbornly the same size, netbooks offer the perfect solution for users who need a smaller, more portable device than their desktop-replacing-laptop machine. So, why do so many people say that **netbooks are dead?**

The problem with netbooks, in my experience, is two-fold.

Firstly, they aren't powerful enough to run Windows well. Not a problem for me as a Linux user, but certainly a problem for them in the general marketplace. The ""typical"" user is looking for an operating system that they recognise, and Linux **just isn't it**. My personal netbook runs an Intel Atom processor and tops out at 2GB of RAM. Ignore what the box says - Windows runs like a drunk, lame dog on that spec and spends more time swapping data on and off the hard drive than it does doing anything else. It's a painful experience that will turn most users off. 

Secondly, most netbooks are not the user's ""main"" computer. Often, they are not even the secondary home machine. If you're a heavy user of email or cloud file storage systems like Dropbox, that sync your filesystem/data to the cloud, firing up a netbook after a few weeks of not using it is a good way to kill 30 minutes as everything ""catches up"". I've waiting hours for a Dropbox sync to finish - unlike most of my other machines, the netbook only comes out when I need it.

Or at least ... it used to. Recently I ""upgraded"" my netbook to run **Android** as the primary OS. The difference is incredible and now my netbook gets fired up every day. I am writing this article on it, in fact. What started out as an experiment to see if I could even *install* Android has turned into a paradigm shift in how I use my various computers.

So, what makes Android on a netbook such an attractive option?

## Speed

An Atom processor and 2GBs of RAM is a spec that any tablet user would drool over. Unsurprisingly, Android runs like a greased whippet on the netbook hardware. Add in the speed advantages of a real hard drive as compared to NAND flash, and you really see a different side to Android performance.

Whilst we're considering specs, it's also worth mentioning that my homebrew Android netbook also has 3 full size USB ports, an SD Card reader, a VGA out, and ethernet. It also has a keyboard... but more on that later.

## What it doesn't have...

Of course, the obviously thing we are missing is multi-touch on the screen. Android actually works perfectly well with a mouse, the only thing I'm not able to do is ""pinch"" to zoom in and out. Other than that, everything works. In fact, in a lot of instances, I would argue that it works *better*. Touch screen is great, but a mouse and pointer lets me see what I'm clicking. I can't do that with touch screen - my hand gets in the way. Particularly when working with text, that pixel-perfect accuracy when clicking to position your cursors saves a lot of time and eliminates a lot of frustration.

## Optimised for a small screen

One of the other advantages of an Android netbook is that all the apps on the Android platform are designed to work on small screens. Whilst most Windows and Linux apps look cramped on the netbook's small screen, Android apps positively languish in the available space. DroidEdit, my new text editor of choice, provides a wonderfully distraction free writing environment running full screen on my netbook.

Most of the applications I have tried detect the netbook book screen as a ""tablet"" resolution and run their tablet interfaces. Google Mail, for example, comes with all the landscape bells and whistles.

There are a few apps that I have found that want to force the orientation of the screen into portrait and this is an problem for obvious reasons. However, none of these have been ""vital"" applications and the forced portrait rotation is often restricted to just the log-in or splash page.

## Optimised for small storage, optimised for cloud storage 

I mentioned earlier the problem of leaving a cloud or internet synced device offline for a long period, after which there is an inevitable period of ""catching up"". Android neatly sidesteps this issue by only syncing the most recent things. Most apps know that they will either not be allowed to use data when not on WiFi or that they must do so sparingly, so what little does need to be ""caught up"" is dealt with very quickly.

Admittedly, the fact I now switch my netbook on a lot more often helps to keep things in sync, but the overall approach to synchronization that is built into the very heart of the Android OS means that I can comfortably skip a few days and not encounter issues.

Cloud storage, also something that is very much at the heart of Android, is also handled differently. No app expects to have the capacious expanse of a hard drive to play with, so the expectations on local storage are far lower. Dropbox, for example, only downloads files when you request them. Rather than sync my 30GB plus Dropbox across, I simply pull down the files that I need. Of course, this assumes I am online or have WiFi when I decide that I need the file, as skips over Dropbox's brilliant change and conflict detection, but the fundamental principle remains very sound - if I am doing something that requires a lot of big files, I am probably on my laptop. This doesn't mean I might not need *one* of those files some other time, but I don't want to sync them all, all the time.

## Apps, apps, apps!

If I had written this article a year or so ago, I might have struggled to justify the Android App Marketplace (now ""Google Play"") as a source for software to replace your desktop apps. Writing this in 2013 however, Google Play is **bristling** with apps to perform just about any task. It seems to me that people are determined to ensure that *anything* they can do on their desktop, they can also do on their Android phone/tablet. The openess of the market is a great help here, and it is easy to find great apps.

If anything, the ability to download apps and run them offline on an Android netbook makes it a serious competitor to a Chromebook in my opinion. 

So, if you want to revitalise some old (or maybe not-so-old) hardware or try out a new way of working, I would highly recommend you build your own Android netbook. (And in my next blog post, I'm going to tell you ***how***)"

<img src=""189423_10150154195811348_572971347_8665610_2395012_n.jpg"" />

Tomorrow I'll be hitting my first comic convention for some time. I'll be going in what I call ""stealth mode"" - paying for my ticket and roaming the alleys between tables as a free agent. *(What do I think about creators who want a free ticket but don't do anything to support the show? That's another blog post entirely...)*

What this has got me thinking about though is the ""pre-convention check list"", that indispensable list of ""must have"" items that I have built up over a good few years of convention-eer-ing. Here's the list, for anyone else getting ready for a show and wondering what it is that they might have forgotten...

## 1: The Pull-Up Banner

If you have never exhibited at a convention before, make sure you get yourself a banner. They are a de-facto standard nowadays and the essential part of your arsenal. Don't expect people to ask who you are - tell them.

## 2: Table Cloth

My first two conventions, I forgot the table cloth and had to beg/borrow/steal one to cover up a fairly ropey wooden panel table. Lots of conventions provide table cloths now, but I still always still take one... just in case. 

Consider like your towel in the Hitchhiker's Guide Universe. **Know where your table cloth is**. And, just because the con gives you one, doesn't mean you can't have your own jazzy number. Mine has skulls.

## 3: A ""Float""

If you comic book is ﾣ2.50, expect to be given fivers, tenners, and twenties and have to make change. Most people hit the cash point on the way to the convention, and it is just embarassing if you can't break down a note after you've broken down a *person* and made them buy your comic.

Having a float is just a professional requirement - if you are there to sell, make it easy for your customer.

## 4: Water, Chocolate, etc.

Conventions are tiring. Food and water, especially the cheap energy hit of some chocolate are essential. Not meaning to be churlish, but a lot of places that hold conventions are also **very** expensive to eat and drink in, so think ahead and make sure you take provisions.

Come Sunday morning, when you trying to shake off that hangover, you will thank your lucky stars for those provisions.

## 5: Charge up your mobile

Conventions happen in real time on Twitter and Facebook just as much in the real world. You can't be everywhere at once, so a charged up mobile can be your link to the virtual side of the convention going on around you.

Make sure you follow the convention's Twitter feed and hashtags to keep up with the news and get involved.

## 6: Stock (some of which thou shalt sacrifice)

I believe in travelling light with stock. You are not going to shift hundreds of copies of your indie comic at a convention so save your time, and save your back muscles, by taking a good *range* of stock in sensible quantities.

Also, be prepared to swap and share with other creators. I much prefer to swap comics for comics with other creators, if they are willing. The contacts you make and the feedback you can get are invaluable.

The only exception to this is if you're pitching yourself to them. If you are, be courteous and buy some of their products. It's common sense - you need to understand what they are about if you're going to work with them.

## 7: Business Cards

I've always believed that the best business card is the kind that's between 24 and 32 pages long, has pictures and words, and tells a story. However, traditional business cards are also very useful.

Make sure you give phone, email, and social network contact details. These don't need to be posh, you're trying to impress Patrick Bateman, but they need to **exist**. If you give me your number on a scrap of paper, or make me write it down, **I will lose it**.

## 8: Pens, Paper, Stationery, etc.

For artists, sketching as some sort of indentured servitude seems to be the norm at comic conventions. As a writer, I've dabbled with ""live writing"" at conventions and whilst it's always worked for *me*, I wouldn't recommend it.

However, even if you don't want to write on a figurative tightrope like I do, conventions are often the time when you get to thrash out ideas with other creators and really ""talk shop"". Be prepared to work in the downtime (like Sunday afternoon, the long great downtime of all cons).

## 9: Painkillers

There is not a convention on Earth that someone does not come to ill, and not a convention on Earth that does not induce ""con-flu"" in most of the attendees. Pack some painkillers and cold remedy. I don't care if you're from the North, pack some painkillers and cold remedy.

## 10: ""The Pitch""

Now, this one might be where I lose a few of you...

If you're at a con, behind a table, selling a comic... be prepared to talk about. Be able to precise it down for someone who takes the time to ask what it is, and be prepared to talk about it. Have a pitch. Because if you don't, *this* is what the guy on the other side of the table is probably thinking... **""You made the damn thing. You wrote, or drew it, or did both. Care enough to tell me what it is, because I've only go so much money here and right now you're not getting any of it.""**

Like I said, I might lose a few of you there, but those are the facts.

## 11: Fun

Oh yeah, I almost forgot - have fun. Conventions are hard work, but they are also an infrequent opportunity to be in the company of like minded people who share your passions (well, not *all* your passions). Make the most of it!

<img src=""social-media-social-networking-connections.jpg"">

[@welshpixie](https://twitter.com/WelshPixie) asked on Twitter today if anyone still ""blogged"" or if microblogging had killed the noble art of writing text longer than 140 characters. Queue large discussion, with people from all ends of the spectrum, and the tweet from [@utahcon](https://twitter.com/utahcon) **""My dream. I blog, it syndicates to Twitter/FB/G+/etc -- Any comments made through those are gathered back into my blog comments.""**

Which, it turns out, is kind of how my blog now works. So, for those who want to know, here's **How to link your blog to your social media channels**

### Step 1: RSS

The clue is in the name - Really Simple Syndication. If your current blog/CMS doesn't support RSS feeds, either get them installed or ditch it. When I switched this blog over to my homebrew engine4 CMS, the first feature I knew I **had** to add was RSS.

RSS is the tool that we're going to use to let all the other networks know what is going on whenever we post a new article to our blog.

### Step 2: Sign up to Twitter Feed

[Twitter Feed](http://www.twitterfeed.com) is a free service that will publish your RSS feed to Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and App.net.

You can sign up for Twitter Feed using a variety of different online accounts and once you have signed up the process for creating your feed is pretty simple.

### Step 3: Add your RSS feed to Twitter Feed (Step 1)

1. From the ""dashboard"" click ""Create New Feed""
1. Give the feed and name and paste in the feed URL. (Mine is [http://www.planetofthepenguins.com/xml/rss](http://www.planetofthepenguins.com/xml/rss))
1. Test the feed, to make sure it is working.
1. Open up the ""Advanced Settings""
1. Set the frequency to 30 minute checks. You may not blog every 30 minutes, but you probably don't want to wait more than 30 minutes for your post to start syndicating.
1. Set the max updates as high as you can - this will give you a little flurry of activity straight away and make sure that you don't lose multiple posts.
1. Set the Post Content and URL shortening to your preferences. I used Title+Description and bit.ly.
1. Set the Sort Order to pubDate, to pick up the most recent posts.

There are also options here for Keyword filtering and adding some tags/content - configure these to your preferences, but remember that you only have 140 characters when posting to Twitter.

### Step 4: Configure your Publishing Services on Twitter Feed (Step 2)

Twitter Feed can post to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and App.net.

Sign in to each one that you want to use and authorise the Twitter Feed app to do what it needs to do.

You only need to add each account once, even if you are working with multiple feeds.

For each service you will have the option of adding UTM tags. If you use Google Analytics, these will allow you differentiate where your blog traffic is coming from when users follow your syndicated links. If you don't use Google Analytics, or do don't need this right now, this can be safely ignored and reconfigured later.

### Step 5: Test it!

Once you have added at least one service, save your feed and head back to the dashboard.

You should see your feed in the dashboard along with the option to ""check now!"". Hit ""check now!"" to see how things are working. Don't expect things to be immediate - clicking check now just puts your blog in the queue to be processed ahead of schedule. 

### Step 6: Do more blogging.

Assuming that all has gone to plan, you will see posts start appearing on your social networks in line with your blogging activity. All you have to do now is blog, remembering that each blog post will automatically syndicate as per the settings that you have entered into Twitter Feed.

---

## Tips and Tricks 

### Help! I don't know what my feed URL is!

Check the address bar of your browser when you are looking at your blog for the RSS icon.

Click on the icon and copy the URL that your browser goes to.

### If I post more than the ""Max Posts"", the posts get lost

This is a feature of Twitter Feed. When it reads your RSS feed, it will take the **X** most recent articles and syndicate them and ignore everything else. When it next checks your feed, it only wants **new content**, and will ignore posts that it has seen before but not published.

### I want to post different things to Twitter and Facebook and LinkedIn.

You can do this by creating adding the same feed to Twitter Feed multiple times. Each Twitter Feed feed can have its own configuration, filters, etc.

<img src=""8554-simcity-dos-screenshot-a-disaster-godzilla-ega-s.gif"">

The latest version of Sim City (Sim City 5) is the latest game to be plagued by the twin monsters of needing an internet connection to play (bad) and having insufficient server capacity to cope with the demands of players (stupid, and bad planning). 

Following hot on the heels of the much vexed Diablo III, which had similar problems, it seems that the games makers **have learnt nothing**.

[Amazon have today removed Sim City 5 from sale](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21712910) in the face of numerous returns and complaints.

So, what's to be done? Well, firstly, games makers need to reassess their approach to piracy.

<iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/MA5Pjw_cZn0?rel=0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

*Electronic Arts: Recent Graduates of the Homer Simpson ""School of Listening""*

Games piracy has gone on certainly for as long as I can remember there being games. When I had a ZX Spectrum, people used cassette players to copy games. When I had a PC, the advent of the CD Writer sent games makers running to the hills in their droves screaming in terror (where they met up with the tribes who had fled there when they heard about *bulletin boards*). Then came the internet, Usenet, torrents ... if you're a games maker then it seems like there is an almost wave of innovations that are designed to make it easier for people to steal your stuff. XBoxes get chipped, encryptions get cracked. Pirates **are everywhere**.

Or are they?

[Various](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/12/my-software-is-being-pirated.html) [sources](http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=17350#.UToH8kGc4pI) online seem to put game piracy at around 90% of the userbase. 

Despite this, the problem remains that assuming *everyone* wants to steal your game means that you start treating every customer like a potential criminal. From the customer's perspective - that stinks. 

You start to embed onnerous security in your products not to *protect* the legitimate buyer, but to ensure that you, as vendor, know where every single copy of your game is. And who is playing. And when. The world of dongles beckons. There's a certain irony of a game where the player weilds a god-like omnipotent power over the denizens of a city being crippled by a vendor who wants to wield a god-like omnipotent power over... well you get the picture. And yet, if figures of 90% software piracy are to be believed, the majority of are *are* criminals?

Personally, I think those numbers are skewed and whilst they are useful for legitimising the presence of stringent and restrictive customer controls, the inescapable reality is that treating legitmate customers as pirates, or as criminals, is just bad for business.

If only 1 in 10 customers want to pay for your product, you don't piss them off if you want to stay in business.

So, what is to be done about software piracy?

Whatever comes next, the most important thing is that it needs to be done **right**. There would be far fewer complianants if EA's servers were fast, responsive, and a slow internet connection (or even, gasp, **no** internet connection) didn't mean you couldn't play. 

Personally, I believe the best piracy protection is the protection that is no protection at all. Instead of trying to *make* your customers pay, focus your efforts on **making your customers want to pay**.

Here, perhaps, are some ways how:

## Downloadable Content (DLC)

A game like Sim City is ripe for DLC. Make the DLC optional, but make it *desirable*.

It doesn't matter if people are stealing the game if they are paying for the downloaded content.

And yes, of course, some DLC will also be pirated. Don't sweat it. Rotate your shields, recharge your phasers, make the next batch *harder* to copy and **release some more compelling content**.

Gamers are completists. That's why they replay games on harder levels and why they want to unlock things. Even for people who dislike DLC (like me), it *works*.

## Real World Content

Skylanders actually does this very well. It's pretty hard to pirate an action figure that unlocks a part of the game. Whilst I joked about the use of dongles previously, they do work, most of the time. (There's always the worry of a [dongle crack](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-dongle-crack.htm)).

## Just make it _good_

For me, the ultimate in making people want to pay is simply ... **making them want to pay**.

In her recent [TED Talk, Amanda Palmer](http://youtu.be/xMj_P_6H69g) gave an inspiring explanation of the ""Art of Asking"". I'm a documented opponent of much of the crowd sourcing the goes on in the comics community, but there is a simplicity and elegance to Amanda's Palmers concept of creating something that people want and making is *easier to pay for it than to steal it* that appeals, very much, to the engineer in me.

## In conclusion

For now, it seems like we need to wait for the technology, or the psychology, of the games makers to catch up. I expect to see more controls in games, not fewer, and think we are a long way from anything like the open source ethos penetrating the world of major games makers.

For now, I'll just keep giving my software away for free. I'm sure the money thing will take care of itself.

People of Suffolk unite, the vegans are on the march. Or, at least, the vegans are sending rude emails to a school that has had the audacity to suggest that children should know that a sausage is made out of parts of a dead pig. Quite what Liza Moore and the rest of the Colchester Animal Defenders make of Turkey Twizzlers is anybody's guess.

Now, you might think this blog post is going to be a bit of rant about those pesky vegans. Sadly, it's not. Putting aside whether anyone said something rude to someone else, in the playground or out of it, they are entitled to their view. Of course they are. They are entitled to voice it and the school, as a public institution, should pay attention to it and take it into consideration. 

What I do think is a bit of problem here though, is **petition websites**.

The petition in question can be found on the [Care 2 Petition](http://www.thepetitionsite.com/701/506/479/request-that-peasenhall-primary-school-reconsider-raising-and-killing-three-piglets/) website. Take a look at it, and see if you can see what I can see. Ignore the rhetoric from the petition organisers - a petition is, at its fundament, a one sided argument. Instead, look at who has *signed up*.

I can see a lot of people who have signed this petition from overseas. Japan, Hungary, Spain. I can see a lot people who signed, but did not bother to say *why*. Is it a technological wonder that people can express their opinion on a topic globally, or is it just the case that signing a petition on *any* topic is now as easy as clicking ""like"" on Facebook?

### I click like on Facebook a lot, but I can tell you this ... I really don't care if that cat gets a cheeseburger or not. ###

The [UK Government's own e-petetion site requires that you are a UK resident to sign a petition](http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/terms-and-conditions), but a great many of the other petition websites have no such restrictions. Is this indicative of a ""global culture"", is it ignorant of the significantly different cultures that exist geographically, or is it just lazy coding? Worse, it is not lazy at all, but very carefully considered, a deliberate attempt to create viral content and build website traffic by imposing no restrictions - no matter how much they might invalidate the content of the petition itself?

Maybe, maybe not. But here's the bigger question... **is morality absolute, or localised?** Is what is acceptable, even ""right"", in one place not the same in another? At what point should our respect for another person's culture, religion, or viewpoint be overidden by a more fundamental understanding of what is right and wrong - and is this even something that we all share?

### Online petitions encourage a sort of ""moral spam"" ###

I have no idea what the answers to these questions are and nor, do I suspect, do the people running these ""pop-up"" petition websites. Whilst, in my mind, there is no doubt that organisations such as Greenpeace use online petitioning and social media very well on a global scale to tackle global issues, the question of whether one school in Suffolk tells kids where sausages come from is in a whole different (and much smaller) league. Whether you agree with the stance or note, those thousands of signatures start to very shakey all of a sudden and the cause, right or wrong, is done no favours by the ""moralistic spamming"" of easy petition signing.

Here's my take on it. If the website you are going to use to run your petition also has a [Vice President of Sales](http://www.care2.com/aboutus/advertise.html) then perhaps you are in the wrong place. There are lots of good websites fighting for change, but **petition websites are not here to save us** - the sooner we wise up, the better a tool for the important fights these websites will be.

<img src=""311296-keep-calm-and-save-google-reader.gif"" />

[Google Reader is being taken behind the chemical sheds and shot on July 1st 2013](http://googlereader.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html). Its users aren't happy. 100,000 of them have signed a [petition to save Google Reader](http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/03/15/petition-to-save-google-reader-passes-100000-signatures-but-dont-expect-google-to-reverse-its-decision/).

Arguably, maintaining Google Reader is not good business sense for Google. Its major rivals on the social scene, Facebook and Twitter, have long since shut down RSS in and out of their platform (unless you use a third party app) and Google+ would no doubt benefit from more people using it to get their news. However, Google+ is unlikely to be the ""go to"" destination for RSS refugees like myself so unless they reverse this decision (not likely, unless you are a Kryptonian and prepared to fly around the globle ***really fast***) then we're going to be reading our news somewhere else.

Thankfully, Feedly, which has been my on-again-off-again Google Reader front end for some time, have unveiled plans to create a stand-alone RSS environment to replace Google Reader. For those not familiar with Feedly, up until now it has taken your Google Reader subscriptions and presented the data in a ""magazine"" format. I makes the news pretty, and a bit more fun. It also has a very nice smartphone client, a bit Flipboard-esque but with far more control over what you get to see.

[Feedly are calling this ""Project Normandy"".](http://blog.feedly.com/2013/03/14/google-reader/). The transition, they claim, will be seamless. Fingers crossed. Right now, I'm making sure I've got Feedly set up *just how I want it*.

## Don't count out Digg

If you're not as keen on Feedly's layout as I am, you might want to consider Digg's [recent unveiled replacement for Google Reader](http://blog.digg.com/post/45355701332/were-building-a-reader).

Personally, I think Feedly is a better option - they have a reader already and have been fine tuning the interface and mobile apps for some time. Digg are coming from a ""standing start"" and whilst you can't critcise their opportunistic moxie, they might not have the time to get the job done."

There have been a **lot** of Iron Man 3 trailers. Arguably, there have been too many and we can only hope that the trailer-monkeys have not used up all the great moments from the movie as they titillate and tease us.

By contrast, ""Iron Man: Rise of the Technovore"" has a brilliant, dialogue free trailer. Plenty of action, plenty of 'splosions, plenty of wow, but not a clue as to what is going on in what could quite easily be a bat-shit-crazy anime styled Iron Man romp.

<img src=""android-and-linux.jpg"" />

You may have read my previous post about [why your netbook should run Android](). If there is one OS that I would put alongside Android on my netbook, it would be Linux - Linux Mint to be precise. There are some tasks where switching easily between one application and another are vital and some things that just aren't possible (yet) on Android - like running and developing on a LAMP stack.

Today, I installed Linux Mint. It spotted an old Ubuntu install (that I had all but forgotten that I had) but it didn't detect Android. As it turns out, GRUB can't detect Android and so getting your Android install to boot again after you have installed Linux is a fiddly business.

## How to break it.

1. Install Android x86 and let it install GRUB
2. Install Linux Mint and let it install GRUB too, squashing the previous GRUB beneath its minty heel
3. Reboot
4. Huzzah for Mint, but weep for lost Android.

## How to fix it.

### Get a GUI for GRUB

Before you do anything else, install the excellent **grub-customizer**. You won't find this in the Debian, Ubuntu, or Mint repositories, so add the repository yourself.

    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer 
    sudo apt-get update 
    sudo apt-get install grub-customizer

I simply don't edit GRUB configs often enough to even care where they are, especially as this seems to change all the time. Use **grub-customizer** to get around this - it will find your GRUB and let you change the configuration visually. At least, a *little* visually. You are still going to need to write those messy GRUB commands... or are you?

### Go and steal the GRUB config you need

Work out which partition Android is installed on. You can do this by running `gparted` and looking at the partitions or by running `fdisk -l` as root at the command line. Mine is on `/dev/sda1`.

Next, mount the Android partition.

Jump to the command line, and find your way to the `grub` directory off the root of the mounted Android partition. Mine was `/media/chris/Androidx86/grub`. In this directory is a file called `grub.lst`. Open this file and copy the contents.

### Use your stolen/recycled GRUB config

Run **grub-customizer** and use it to create a new GRUB entry.

Edit this entry, starting with a new line that reads `set_root='hd0,X` where X is the number of the partition where Android can be found. Mine was on `dev/sda1`, so my set_root is `set_root='hd0,1`.

Next, paste in the two lines from the copied config for Android x86 that *look like this* (yours will be different, maybe):

    linux /android-2011-08-15/kernel quiet root=/dev/ram0 \androidboot_hardware=eeepc \ acpi_sleep=s3_bios,s3_mode \ video=-16 DPI=160 SRC=/android-2011-08-15
    initrd /android-2011-08-15/initrd.img

Save the entry. This will take a couple of seconds as your GRUB config will now be reloaded.

### Reboot and Rejoice

Reboot and you should have the option for Android x86 back in your bootloader.

---

## Why not just install Android x86 second?

Just as Linux GRUB didn't want to detect Android, the Android GRUB bootloader won't spot Linux. The *latest version* can spot Windows, but that's it. My recommendation, if you are doing a ground-upwards build, is to **install Android first**, then install Linux, then use these instructions to fix GRUB."

<img src=""google+.jpg"">

[Google have announced the Blogger now has support for in-line Google+ comments.](http://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/bringing-google-comments-to-blogger.html)

If this sounds like no big deal to you, step back and think about the *bigger picture*.

Google+ is the strongest social signal in Google's algorithm, especially when you are searching Google as a logged in user. Here's some evidence...

<div style=""width: 420px"">

Austin SEO</a> company, To view the original post, see the original
<a href=""http://www.tastyplacement.com/infographic-testing-social-media-signals-in-search"">
Social Media Infographic</a>. </div>

And if that evidence isn't enough for you, here's some logic...

1. **Google want you to use Google+**. 
2. Google want Google+ to appear on as many webpages as Facebook and Twitter so that people use it more often and it can attract new users
3. Google make Google+ important to webmasters and SEO practitioners by making it part of the algorithm, so they all implement Google+

Do Google really cynically manipulate the behaviour of website owners in this way? They certainly control activity, by controlling the search index and enforcing what they view as ""good"" behaviour. Whether or not this is cynical depends on what you think their motivations are for doing that - simple profit making or ""to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful"" as per their mission statement.

The important thing to take onboard is that Google+ comments just became a lot more powerful than they once were, because they are moving outside the ""walled garden"" of Google+ itself and becoming part of the wider web.

## Phase 1: Blogger becomes more powerful

There is an accepted wisdom that ""Wordpress is good for SEO"" (a topic for another blog post). By integrating the strongest social signal into its own platform, Google have tipped the playing field back in their favour. It is important to take into account, as well, that there are more people with Google+ accounts every day, which means more users who don't need to authenticate themselves before they post a comment. With the half-life on the desire to write a comment being incredibly short, this is another important change.

In short, you can expect more comments and you can expect them to be important to your SERP position and traffic.

## Phase 2: Google+ rolls out to other platforms

This is an absolute ""no brainer"" for Google in my opinion. Once the embedding of the commenting system is proven and scaled in Blogger, rolling out embed code for other platforms will extend the reach of the Google+ platform exponentially.

Think about it - if you want to *organise the world's information* then taking control of the feedback loop on that information is a great idea."

Today, Celtx has 4.6 million users (Source: [Herald Business](http://thechronicleherald.ca/business/1124725-entrevestor-celtx-s-growth-makes-huge-leap)) and more and more of them are upgrading from the free service to the paid for versions of the software.

Whilst I am no longer the Celtx fan that I used to be, it is great to see a product like this growing and making a difference in an otherwise pretty turgid part of the software industry. I hate the attitude that some writers have that you have to be using a particular piece of software if you are ""serious"" about your writing. Nobody, and I mean _nobody_ needs to spend hundreds of pounds/dollars just to get started putting their ideas together, and owning the same software as JJ Abrams doesn't mean you are going to write the next Star Trek (or, thankfully, *Cloverfield*).

<img src=""amazon_and your done.jpg"" />

Keeping tracks of the ups and downs of Amazon and its Kindle ecosystem is something every writer should be doing. Amazon and its Kindle are, in effect, a market in and of itself and if you're serious about selling copies your writing, Amazon is one of the biggest games in town.

April 2013 was a busy month for Amazon, here are the highlights.

## Amazon doesn't like Welsh or Cornish

Amazon has taken some flack for not supporting books written in Welsh or Cornish. Historically, it was possible to publish books in Welsh by filing them as ""English"", but with Amazon's software now checking the content of the books this is no longer possible. [Y Lolfa, a small publisher based near Aberystwyth, has been campaigning for Welsh to be an accepted language](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/04/15/wales_language_amazon/). Although a spokesman for Amazon claimed it is working on plans to offer the language in future, there was no definite timeline and it sounds like this argument might run and run.

Meanwhile, over in pixie territory, [Amazon have been engaged in a very public spat with the Cornish Language Board](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/apr/15/ebooks-amazon-diglot-kindle-language).

The reality here seems to be that Amazon have introduced a control over languages before it has introduced the technical ability to handle the breadth of languages that people want to publish in. The list of supported languages is actually pretty short. It seems people are prepared to fight, and fight hard, however for the right to publish - a clear indicator of how vital Amazon Kindle sales have become as part of most publisher's sales strategies.

If you're working on any new writing in a language that Amazon doesn't support *today*, you may need to consider whether Amazon Kindle sales can be a part of your immediate sales strategy.

## Amazon does like India

[Redington](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redington_(India)_Limited) has tied up a deal with Amazon to [distribute the Amazon Kindle in India](http://www.bgr.in/news/redington-starts-distributing-amazons-kindle-devices-in-india/)

Before you decide that this doesn't matter for *you*, take a look at this 2011 article that predicts that [India will become the largest market for English books within 10 years](http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/south-asia/publishers-get-a-measure-of-indias-booming-english-book-market).

Amazon's push into this territory is significant and could represent a new, hungry market for eBooks.

## Amazon REALLY likes comics (and maybe pirates)

Without a great deal of fanfare, Amazon also rolled its tanks across Comixology's borders with the release of the [Kindle Comic Creator](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&docId=1001103761&linkCode=ur2&tag=richjohnston-20) this month.

Allowing you to create .mobi files of comics to publish via Kindle either from image files *or by extracting images from ePub files*, the launch of this software should send shivers down the spines of other digital comics vendors. The Amazonian leviathan is stirring Comixology... you're going to need a bigger boat.

It will be interesting to see if any non-comics creators are drawn in by the features of the Kindle Comic Creator as well. Will we see panel-view enabled children's books, instruction manuals, or educational titles? Watch this space...

As an aside, this software does also seem to open up the world of digital comics piracy a little as well. Expect to see a shift from .CBR to panel-view enabled .mobi files in the Usenet groups (not that I go there, it's just what I hear)."

How Wordpress is killing other websites and how to stop yours from ""turning"" #

<img src=""zombie joker.jpg"" />

[A recent report from security consultancy Incapsula](http://www.incapsula.com/the-incapsula-blog/item/715-wordpress-security-alert-pingback-ddos) concluded that an DDOS attack launched against a large gaming website used approximately 2,500 Wordpress sites, including gizmodo.it and zendesk.com. [The full list of offenders is here](http://www.incapsula.com/wp-botnet-pingback-abuse.txt)

What is most interesting is that these sites hadn't been compromised. Instead, the attack leveraged new default functionality in Wordpress 3.5 to generate a flood of ""ping back"" requests to the site under attack. Ping backs are designed to aid cross referencing between blogs, but can be used to generate millions of requests to a single website from a range of IP addresses.

<img src=""http://www.incapsula.com/images/wp-http-ddos-by-abusing-pingback.png"" />

The report goes on say that the majority of Wordpress sites are now vulnerable to this sort of abuse, as Ping Back is switched on by default in version 3.5 of Wordpress. The problem is therefore serious and **massive** - there are to the order of 100 million Wordpress blogs in existence.

In short? There are a lot of zombies out there, and your blog could be one of them.

For a lot of people, Wordpress is the ""go to"" blogging platform. In many instances, it has become the CMS equivalent to ""no one got sacked for buying IBM"". It is so ubiquitous and well known that you can slide a Wordpress site into any content strategy and even the most dusty Luddite will nod sagely and say something like ""I've heard of that"". Designers and developers alike love it (mostly) and this really a part of the problem.

Running a Wordpress sites are not the same as running a hosted Tumblr page. Even though you might use it for the same things, the underlying power of the beast is totally different, and most users won't take the time to review security settings or even to upgrade for the latest security features.

*Still*, for the bright sparks still paying attention at the front of the class...

## Here's how to make sure your Wordpress blog isn't being used for DDOS

<img src=""Columbus-Tallahassee-zombieland-11140337-1600-1200.jpg"" />

The guys over at Wordpress aren't going to fix this any time soon. [The potential for Ping Back DDOS from Wordpress has been a known issue for over six years](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4137) so, in the words of zombie killing maestro Tallahassee... ""It's time to nut up, or shut up!""

### Switch off Ping Back

You can disable Ping Back from your Wordpress Control Panel in `Settings>Discussion>Default article settings`

### Double Tap: Delete the xmlrpc.php file

<img src=""tumblr_m9g2xmp5fa1rpw90y.png"" />

The S.H.I.E.L.D TV show is go, with Joss Whedon at the helm and some faimilar Whedon-verse talent behind the scenes. The *real* buzz around this show however is the ""resurrection"" of Agent Phil Coulson.

**If you haven't seen Avengers - look away now. Actually, look away forever. Thanks... **

Coulson was killed by Loki on the Helicarrier, an act that forged the alliance between Avengers and ""gave them something"" (in the words of Nick Fury). Queue an internet meme, delivered as only nerds on the internet can, calling for the return of Coulson or spouting the conspiracy that Coulson *isn't as dead as we thought*. It is established in the Avengers that Fury ""twists the knife"" of Coulson's death by convincing Captain America that Coulson's precious Captain America trading cards were in his pocket when he was killed - an emotive moment for Steve Rogers and a reminder for the audience of who and what Nick Fury really *is* and the lengths that he will go to to win. The prevailing theory online therefore is that Coulson isn't dead at all, just hiding.

Personally I think this is a terrible option. Coulson's death is a pivotal moment in the movie and a poignant moment for a character who had tied together the ""Phase 1"" Marvel movie universe. Let's not have him hiding in a cupboard for the end of the movie. That might be Nick Fury's style, but it isn't Phil Coulson's. 

So, how do we bring back Coulson? Here's some ideas...

## 1: Coulson is a robot

<img src=""Avengers-Vision-e1334638499733.jpg"" />

There is something mechanical/robotic about Coulson. He's super polite, super calm. Nothing phases him. It is not a big leap to think that he's been an android all this time, but I prefer that idea that Phil Coulson was real and Phil Coulson died, then someone took Coulson's memories and put them into a robot.

Fury's just lost his right hand man, his go-to field operative. If someone, let's say **Hank Pym** (who hasn't made a movie appearance yet, has he?), offers him a chance to get Coulson back? Fury would jump at it.

I like this option because it leaves the door open for interaction with the Avengers in a way that ""I was hiding"" just doesn't. They already distrust Fury, what happens when they find out that he's brought their mutual friend back from the dead as a soulless machine? 

Add to this the fact that Hank Pym's robots have a habit of going ""a bit mental"", and you've got a recipe for something exciting. False memories and the question about ""who we are"" when we are disconnected from our bodies is ground familiar to Joss and Jed Whedon from Dollhouse, so this could be a safe bet - especially with Marvel pushing their ""Age of Ultron"" event in the comic book universe.

## 2: Coulson is a clone.

<img src=""629973-clones1_super.jpg"" />

Coulson sure gets around, doesn't he? 

Maybe there always more than one Phil Coulson. Again, this weakens the pathos of what happened in Avengers and does skate dangerously close to the poison that is ""Spider Clones"", but it is not without precedent.

I think we should leave that there. Walk away *very quickly*.

## 3: Coulson is a Skrull

<img src=""AvengersSkrulls122810.jpg"" />

We thought we where getting Skrulls in Avengers, but we got some pretty disposable villains in the Chitauri instead. So, Skrulls are still available.

Again, I don't think original Coulson was a Skrull, but *new Coulson* sure could be. In fact, there are a quite a few ways that Skrull Coulson works for me, here are my two favourites...

### ""Little Phil's a Skrull""

Phil's a great guy who adopted a Skrull baby, lost on Earth. Now Daddy's dead and ""Little Phil"" is grieving so much that he's stuck looking like his adopted Dad. He can only access his Skrull powers occasionally, so he doesn't overpower the other characters and nobody really trusts him either - he's an alien who looks like their dead friend, after all.

If Marvel want to foreshadow a ""Secret Invasion"" storyline for the Marvel Universe, Phil Coulson's Skrull Baby could be really useful.

### New Phil is a Skrull Ambassador

Sometime during the ""Phase 1"" Marvel movies, Phil Coulson is exchanged with an ambassador from the Skrull Empire in a political move by Nick Fury, desperate to form any alliance he can in the wake of Thor's arrival on Earth.

They get Phil, we get one of theirs. New Phil takes Old Phil's place and ""walks a mile"" in his shoes. Shoes that end up covered in blood when he's killed by Loki.

With relations between Earth and the Skrulls strained, a new ambassador arrives to take the place of his fallen comrade. Turns out Earth's a dangerous place even for a Skrull, and ""New Phil"" is here to clean house.

## 4: We don't know, but we think something happened to time?

<img src=""Scarlet-Witch-marvel-superheroines-10397121-1280-581.jpg"" />

News has spread on the internet that the next Avengers movie will feature Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver.

Quicksilver has a nice ""movie compatible"" set of powers, but the Scarlet Witch could be more of a leap - unless Marvel give her a good run in somewhere else. We've seen Wanda turn the world upside down with her reality warping powers, so who's to say that she can't bring Phil Coulson back from the dead? 

Taking this route, I'd like to see a ""mystery"" angle to Coulson's reappearance. He's back, but neither he nor we know how or why. Does Fury know? Maybe, but if he does then he's not telling. Instead, we get to watch Coulson put the pieces together as he and his team track down mysterious events around the globe. The shadowy player behind it all? A crazy Wanda Maximoff who can't help but change things.

Of course, if Phil takes her down, he could be signing his own death warrant.

Google have developed a habit of closing down open protocols and replacing them proprietary or closed applications.

Google Reader, the powerful RSS reader, has been killed off. The replacement? Reading your ""news"" in Google+.

CalDAV support was dropped from Google Calendar, disconnecting the app from third party applications.

Now, Google have dropped XMPP from Google Talk, disconnecting third party apps such as Pidgin. XMPP has been part of Google Talk for over a decade and was also the protocol that underpinned the ill-fated Google Wave project.

Are Google building a wall around their services, abandoning open protocols in favour of closed systems and/or APIs that require you to have a Google Account? I certainly looks like it, or maybe they just like burning down their house and starting over...

Whatever the reason, this volatility in the Google App stack is something that technologists need to keep an eye on. If you're considering moving your business to Google Apps, you need to consider whether any of the apps that could be on Google's hit list in the future are ""must haves"" for your organisation."

<img src=""3d printed gun test fire.jpg"" />

Here's a video of another **3D printed gun** being fired (admittedly, fired by pulling a bit of string from a safe distance, but still...)

<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/g3eDSGVsLQU"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The first 3D printable gun was designed by Defense Distributed and whilst the blueprints were taken down on the orders of the U.S. State Department, they are still widely available online through the likes of Pirate Bay.

The gun in the video above is the first of what will no doubt be numerous copy-cats, and it is *frightening*. Why? Because it costs $25 to print on a $1,725 printer and is robust enough to survive eight shots. OK, so it has to be manually reloaded and is basically a single shot gun, but do you really want everyone on your street to own a musket? 

Application of Moore's Law to this problem means we are probably going to get a gun that is twice as powerful, or half as expensive, within two years. Given the average teenage boy's fascination with guns, I think it is going to be a lot quicker than that. It's probably an even shorter amount of time until somebody **blows their own fingers off**.

Gun control just a lot tougher.

On May 16th 2013, Google announced a new microformat schema for logos.

Part of the Organisation markup on [schema.org](http://www.schema.org), the markup is remarkably simple.

    <div itemscope itemtype=""http://schema.org/Organization"">
    <a itemprop=""url"" href=""http://www.example.com/"">Home</a>
    <img itemprop=""logo"" src=""http://www.example.com/logo.png"" />
    </div>


Considering the amount of time and energy that goes into creating a logo, especially when compared to how simple the markup above is, getting your brand to appear in the search results should be a no-brainer.

So, anyone want to make me a fancy logo for the blog?"
