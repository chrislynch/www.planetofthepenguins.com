# Bubble:<br>A Plain Text Markup Format for Comic Book Scripts

## What is Bubble?

Bubble is a plain-text format for comic book scripts.

This means that you can write your script without worrying about numbering pages and panels, centering dialogue or getting character names into uppercase.

By learning a simple syntax, you can write your script quickly and then automatically format it when it is complete.

Bubble is designed to be unobtrusive and require the minimum number of keystrokes to achieve completion. It works around your writing, 
doesn't get in the way and doesn't break your creative flow. It is great for blocking out page and panels because it doesn't care 
where you leave blanks.

Bubble is platform and editor agnostic. It is portable, flexible, future-proof, and free.

Bubble works great with cloud storage services like Dropbox and Evernote, so you can store your scripts online
and access them from anywhere.

The Bubble format is simple to learn and readable when it hasn't been formatted.

Bubble's formatted output is in HTML. You can easily style this to your liking using CSS or you can convert the HTML into any other format you like.

## How do I get started with Bubble?

Run the [Bubble Plain Text Comics Markup Application](app/bubble) in your browser.
Write a short script in Bubble and try it out! (If you need help, there is a short sample script in the right sidebar of this page).

Bubble is implemented in PHP and an API will soon be available so that you can include Bubble formatted text in your website
or link Bubble to your application.

## What inspired Bubble?

Inspired by Markdown and Fountain.io, Bubble's aim is enable comic book writers to use any plain text editor to create 
scripts, safe in the knowledge that they will be able to convert them into an industry standard format at any time.

Because scripts are plaintext you can use tools on them for version control and collaboration that aren't available on other platforms.

## Who made Bubble?

Bubble was created by UK comics writer Chris Lynch.

After many years of trying different editors, from Microsoft Word to Final Draft and Celtx, Chris decided that a Markdown-like
solution was what he really wanted. When he realised that one didn't *exist*, he created it. Bubble was born.

## Why is Bubble free?

Bubble is free because it should be. Nobody should be paying tens or hundreds of pounds for software to format their script the 
"right" way. **Take Bubble, make comics.**
