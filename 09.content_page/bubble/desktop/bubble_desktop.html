# What is Bubble Desktop?

Bubble Desktop is an offline Bubble convertor for anyone who doesn't want to install and run PHP on their own machine just to convert Bubble Markup/down into HTML and scripts.

You can get started by [downloading Bubble Desktop here](_downloads/bubble-desktop-version-0-1.zip).

## Why make Bubble Desktop?

Bubble desktop was initially created *because someone asked*.

Logically, making a version of Bubble available offline makes a huge amount of sense because people aren't necessarily online 24x7. If you're working on a script at a coffee shop, library, or the toilets of your office (we've all been there), then 
it makes sense to be able to carry Bubble with you. Plus, we've all seen online services go *offline*, and I don't want anyone to feel like writing in Bubble means being married to me/my website.

## How is Bubble Desktop built?

Version 0.1 of Bubble Desktop is purely the convertor for Bubble. You can write a script in it if you like, but you will need to copy and paste the output to some other app to save it. 
Personally, I recommend writing in your text editor of choice and then firing up Bubble Desktop just to convert your text into a script.

This version of Bubble Desktop uses [php-desktop](http://code.google.com/p/phpdesktop) to bring the PHP code of Bubble to you, wherever you are.

## What's cool about Bubble Desktop?

Bubble Desktop can be unzipped to a USB key and runs on Windows. Only one of these things is cool.

## So, is Bubble becoming a Desktop App?

Yes and no. I'm looking at ways to expand what Bubble does and having a desktop version is something people obvious *want*.

At the moment I am looking at moving over to TideSDK so that the online and offline version of Bubble can essential share a code base. 

I would like to build a completely platform agnostic app that can be run from a USB key on Windows, Mac, or Linux that has proper editing functionality, outlining, and the ability to deal with attached files.

Think Scrivener, but just for comics or Comixwriter but without the price tag.

## Bubble Desktop is free?

Yes, true believer. Bubble is, and always will be, free software.
