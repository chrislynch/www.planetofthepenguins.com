# engine4:<br>
# Welcome to the anti-framework

engine4 is an "anti-framework", a framework that does not require you to work in a particular way or to subscribe to a particular methodology. There is **no MVC**, **no MVVM**. 
It doesn't drop twenty plus directories into your application or make you do anything you don't want to do.

Out of the box, it is completely **file based**, has **zero-configuration** requirements, and **runs incredibly quickly.**

engine4's only job is kickstart your development with a core library to handle the job of pulling the various parts of your application together, a set of selected common libraries to save you time in picking and choosing 3rd party components, and a set of "helper" classes to take the pain out of day-to-day tasks.

# engine 4 features

## File Driven

Out of the box, engine 4 is **completely file based**. 
Mix HTML, plain-text, and **markdown** files to create your site or application however you want to.

## Completely customisable

engine4 has a **variable structure and workflow**. You can use a design pattern, such as **MVC**, or just hack your way to victory.
Work in the way you want and customise the framework or follow the **well-defined examples** in the documentation.

## Fast and Light-Weight

engine4 doesn't carry any baggage with it and contains only the tools you need to **get the job done.**

engine4 includes **hand-picked 3rd party libraries**, documentation and code samples, but you can drop them all and 
take just the framework with you if that's all you need.
